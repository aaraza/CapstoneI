PIEDRAS NEGRAS, Coahuila — Authorities in this border city continue to probe a failed kidnapping that turned into a triple murder outside of a local junkyard. While local media have claimed that the murder was a gang hit, the victim’s relatives revealed that the case was something else.

Preliminary information points to the victims decorating a local business for a party in the Laguito Mexicano neighborhood when the shooting happened. The victims have been identified as 28-year-old Jorge “Copetes” Rosales and his employees Aaron “N” and El Pepo. The murder scene is approximately six miles from this city’s downtown area.

According to the victim’s relatives, two vehicles with gunmen followed Rosales to his business where they tried to kidnap him in an apparent effort to collect a ransom. The victim tried to fight back while two of his employees rushed to his aid. The gunmen shot them and fled the area. Days after the murder, local residents reported that a second kidnapping attempt had taken place but the victims had managed to escape unharmed.

According to local residents, they have recently seen a spike in the number of kidnappings at the hands of organized crime members who are trying to supplement their incomes. As Breitbart Texas revealed, the area of Piedras Negras is famous for the kidnapping and murder of more than 300 between 2011 and 2013 in the state’s northern region. Most of the victims were incinerated inside a state prison.

*TITLE: Eight Million Illegal Aliens Qualify for Deportation Under Trump, Says Report

An estimated eight million illegal alien living in the U.S. could qualify for deportation under President Donald Trump’s immigration plan.

According to figures compiled by the Los Angeles Times, the total comes after speaking with experts reviewing details of Trump’s immigration overhaul and law enforcement agencies who will implement the orders.

Under Trump’s immigration orders, nearly any illegal alien who comes in contact with law enforcement officers can be deported for entering the country illegally, as the LA Times notes.

Many of those eight million illegal aliens hold jobs in the U.S. where they have lied on federal documents, claiming they are eligible to work in the country; acts subject to deportation.

Likewise, smaller cohorts of the population improperly receiving welfare benefits, using fraudulent identity cards, or found driving without a license will qualify for removal as well.

Illegal immigrants who have been accused or convicted of crimes, specifically violent ones, will be prioritized for deportation.

Ronald Mortensen with the Center for Immigration Studies (CIS) wrote that the eight million illegal immigrants eligible for deportation would mean Trump’s order could deport some 75 percent of the country’s illegal alien population.

Mortensen argues that the perpetuated narrative of illegal aliens paying into the Social Security system through payroll taxes means that they fraudulently obtained Social Security numbers, sometimes even stolen from American citizens.

“So, until President Trump issued E.O. 13768, the career politicians that he replaced had consistently put illegal aliens first and deliberately ignored the terrible harm done to the American men, women, and children whose Social Security numbers are stolen,” Mortensen wrote in a blog post.

“Rather than protecting Americans, career politicians and their business, media, and faith-based allies stood by as the medical records of innocent children were corrupted by illegal aliens using their Social Security numbers, with life-threatening consequences,” Mortensen continued. “They did nothing as their constituents’ and neighbors’ credit records were destroyed by illegal aliens and as the arrest records of illegal aliens were attached to the stolen Social Security numbers of hard-working Americans.”

Trump’s overhaul is a major contrast to former President Obama’s immigration orders, where only about 1.4 million illegal aliens were considered qualified for deportation.

*TITLE: Police: Man with Revoked FOID Card Had ’56 Handguns,’ 1000s of Rounds of Ammo

When police searched the home of Donald F. Franz in Crystal Lake, Illinois, they found “56 handguns,” an unspecified number of long guns, and “thousands of rounds of ammunition.”

At one time, Franz had a Firearm Owners Identification (FOID) card which had been revoked, but Illinois State Police will not say when or why.

SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

According to the Chicago Tribune, Illinois State Police say it is not uncommon for former FOID card holders to retain their firearms unless they commit a crime which draws attention to themselves. State police Master Sgt. Matt Boerwinkle indicated that “the agency doesn’t have the manpower to… [confiscate] statewide, and [relies] on local police to follow up. Some local departments check on expired FOID card holders, he said, but many do not.”

In the case of Franz, he was pulled over in Chicago in April 2016 “after disregarding a red light.” He “showed signs of possible intoxication,” and police found “open alcohol containers [in his car], empty beer bottles, ammunition, an unloaded gun on the floor and a loaded handgun in the center console.” He was “charged with DUI and illegally possessing a firearm and ammunition without a valid FOID card.” On January 19 of this

On January 19 of this year, Franz was found “in his car” after police received a tip about a driver who was possibly impaired. When they approached Franz, he grew “uncooperative and combative.” They searched his car and “found a loaded gun and ammunition in the vehicle.”

He is also accused of calling Attorney Registration and Disciplinary Commission officials in December and leaving a voicemail that said, “My name is Don Franz… The day you suspend me, I’m going to stop taking my pills, I’m going to get my affairs in order, I am going to kill you. Have a nice day.” But state police will not say when exactly Franz’s FOID card was revoked.

Following the January 19 incident, police obtained a search warrant and found the “56 handguns,” numerous long guns, and ammunition.

The Illinois Council Against Handgun Violence wants more stringent confiscatory rules and also wants the state to require all gun owners to register their firearms. Illinois State Rifle Association director Richard Pearson responded to the council’s wishes, saying, “Well, with these people, it’s always a witch hunt for gun owners. They want the siren screaming and police ramming down your door.”

*TITLE: Virgil: The Left Whips Up a Climate of Violence — the Prime Target Is Donald Trump

1. Target: Trump

Is there a media-driven “climate of violence”? You bet there is, and it’s being whipped up by the left and the Main Stream Media, here and around the world. And it has a clear purpose: The ultimate goal is the destruction of the Trump presidency—and, for at least some, seemingly, the goal is the assassination of President Trump himself.

SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

But don’t take Virgil’s word for it: Have a look at the cover of Village magazine. That cover shows a rifle’s crosshairs superimposed on a photograph of Trump’s head. And the headline reads, “Why not.”

The once-obscure magazine, published in Ireland, is now basking in worldwide attention, and American social media are happy to magnify Village’s glorification of a criminal act. Here’s that deadly image, for example, on Twitter. As an aside, we might ask: Doesn’t Twitter have rules against “hate speech” and “incitement of violence”? Or are they not enforced when the target is on the right?

The Village article itself plays a clever editorial game. It begins by describing Trump as “a purveyor of hatred” and then lists all his other purported sins, including the mistreatment of refugees, an overall wrong-headed foreign policy, retrograde ideas on “climate change,” and opposition to abortion.

After that litany, the magazine considers the options: “So perhaps the solution is tyrannicide. As he might say himself—‘take him out.’”

Next, under the heading, “Kill Him?” the magazine proceeds to cite philosophers and theologians who have declared tyrannicide to be justifiable, from Cicero to Thomas Aquinas to Martin Luther. And then, to rub the point in even harder, the magazine admiringly recalls the German Klaus von Stauffenberg, who nearly succeeded in killing Hitler in 1944. The message is obvious: Trump is another Hitler, and so you, the reader, must decide for yourself what to do next.

Yet then, having raised all these issues in the most load-the-deck manner possible, the magazine pulls back, sort of, at the last moment. It writes, “Shooting Trump is unnecessary and disproportionate.”

Of course, we all know what’s going on here. Indeed, Virgil recognizes the technique employed by Village as a variant on the ancient rhetorical device known as paralepsis–that is, raising an idea while pretending not to raise it. Having argued, vehemently and at length, that Trump is a civilization-level menace, the magazine then adds a few weasel-words about not harming him. So Village hopes that it has itself covered: If any bad fate befalls Trump, its writers will say, as they barely conceal their smirks, “Gee, we didn’t want that to happen!”

Indeed, even before the Village article, the idea of killing the 45th president was out there—bigtime. Various celebrities and rappers have wished death, if not murder, on Trump.

And Twitter seems to be a favored venue: The online publication Mashable reports in just the first 12 days of the Trump presidency, more than 12,000 tweets have called for the President’s assassination. As the story notes, this volume of threats is far beyond the capacity of the US Secret Service to investigate.

Meanwhile, the incendiary attacks keep coming. Under the header, “Beau Willimon Declares War On Donald Trump,” Deadline: Hollywood details the strenuous efforts of the House of Cards creator to bring the President down. The article details Willimon’s voluminous tweets, including his own mock-version of the Declaration of Independence, which begins with the words:

When in the course of American history it becomes necessary for the people to save our Nation from a Tyrant,

We can pause over that word, “tyrant.” At the end of his 25-tweet rant, Willimon writes that his preferred method for getting rid of Trump is impeachment. However, a casual reader might not read all the way to the end. Or a reader with his or her own imagination might be provoked into think that stronger measures are needed; that is, by any means necessary. And Trump is, after all, a “tyrant,” right? Some undoubtedly will think of the Latin words spoken by John Wilkes Booth moments after he shot President Lincoln in 1865: Sic semper tyrannis! (Thus always to tyrants!)

Of course, Twitter, could delete all these inflammatory tweets with the flick of an algorithm, and yet it doesn’t seem interested in doing anything at all. One might even speculate that Twitter management agrees with them.

Meanwhile, as we all remember, Twitter has always been in a quick hurry to enforce left-wing PC orthodoxy on right-wingers; it has permanently suspended the Twitter account of Milo Yiannopoulos, as well as others, for supposed non-criminal incitement. And yet now, confronted with literal criminal incitement, Twitter does nothing. It doesn’t take a student of classical rhetoric to recognize hypocrisy.

Perhaps one day, Twitter, and other social media, will get around to deleting these offensive, dangerous, and illegal posts. Of course, perhaps one day, it will be too late. Perhaps then, in the view of the anti-Trump haters, it will be a case of the end justifying the means—“mission: accomplished.”

2. The “Climate of Violence”—The Left Loves It So Much

So let’s look more closely at this idea of a “climate of violence,” which is said to foster acts of actual violence. Sometimes this inflammatory “climate” is real, and sometimes it is not real. We’ve learned that while the political left usually says that it opposes this sort of violence-inducing “climatology,” in fact, quite often, it embraces it—even adores it.

Yes, today, the left talks a lot about “peace,” “coexistence,” and all that. And yet, as Virgil wrote in January, when it comes to Trump, one tool of the left, the MSM, gets notably militant; it becomes hormonally eager to reach for violent imagery.

So it’s in this context that we must evaluate extreme anti-Trump media items, such as the semi-suggestion of Rosa Brooks, a former high official in the Obama administration, that what’s needed is a military coup d’etat against the Trump White House. We can note that Brooks published this piece in a well-known MSM outlet, Foreign Policy, on January 30, and it’s still there. Nobody in the MSM, at least, seems to have a problem with it.

More recently, in the same pro-violence spirit, the German magazine Der Spiegel, arguably the most influential publication in that country, unveiled a cover story showing a knife-wielding Trump holding high the bloodily decapitated head of Liberty, from the Statue of Liberty. The message to readers is clear: We must stop this madman before it’s too late.

We can note that the Spiegel cover was admiringly echoed all over the planet; among the admirers was The Washington Post, which, sticking up for the American media, pointed out that The New York Daily News had presented a similar cover back in December 2015.

Meanwhile, as John Nolte has chronicled, CNN has been a serial offender: For more than a year now, it has hurled, against Trump, just about every loaded epithet imaginable.

And it’s not just Trump. It’s also his staff that’s in the crosshairs. For instance, on February 5, USA Today published an editorial entitled, “What Bannon shares with ISIL leader.” Yes, you read that right: A newspaper that claims a readership in the many millions just equated White House adviser Stephen K. Bannon and the Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. As the piece asserted brazenly, the two “share similar world views.”

We might pause to note that this was an editorial, as opposed to a random opinion piece. In other words, the words represent the collective judgment of the USA Today editorial board, whose names can be found here. Yes, this is what they really think. The sheer nuttiness of the editorial aside, we can observe that the piece is seemingly an open invitation to take, uh, strong action against Bannon.

So, yes, the left hates the “climate of violence”—except when it loves it.

And there’s a long history: Perhaps the most cynical use of the “climate” trope has been the way that the left has twisted the cultural and historical memory of the assassination of President John F. Kennedy in 1963.

That tragic incident, of course, occurred in Dallas; then, and now, North Texas has been a conservative area. And so for more than half-a-century, it’s been an MSM cliche—boosted by prominent historians, such as Arthur Schlesinger, Jr.—that a local “climate of hate” was somehow responsible for JFK’s death. Even today, after it’s been established beyond doubt that the assassin, Lee Harvey Oswald, was a pro-Castro communist, the “climate of hate” meme still persists in the MSM. In other words, it’s the fault of Dallas, and the right, that Kennedy was murdered.

Similarly, after the 2011 shooting of Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, the left/MSM immediately heaped the blame on “right-wing media.” And this drumbeat has continued, even after it was learned that the shooter, Jared Lee Loughner, was sexually obsessed with Giffords and was listening to nothing but the voices in his head.

More recently still, in 2016, we were reminded that the left never objects to a climate of violence—if it’s for a “good cause.” Thanks to the efforts of James O’Keefe and others, it’s easy to find abundant, we-have-it-on-tape evidence that the Clinton campaign, or at least its close allies, deliberately sent provocateurs to Trump rallies to cause trouble—trouble which then could then be blamed on Trump. In the summarizing words of Breitbart’s Joel Pollak:

Clinton’s defenders might claim she did not know anything about the tactics being used, but that defense does not suffice. The consultants who carried out the tactic, centered around Robert Creamer and his Democracy Partners organization, told O’Keefe’s undercover investigators that they had set up a “double-blind” system so that Clinton would not have to know directly about any particular action being taken on her behalf, but Creamer appeared to admit on video that Clinton had general knowledge about their activities.

Needless to say, state and local authorities have been completely uninterested in pursuing any of these seemingly open-and-shut cases of conspiracy and incitement.

And the beat goes on. In DC on January 21, the pop-singer Madonna, speaking to a large crowd of angry feminist protesters, mused about “blowing up the White House.” And she has continued to defend her remarks, which could reasonably be construed as incitement to violence, even murder. (One can only imagine what would have happened if a conservative had said that.) And yet of course, Madonna will face no economic or legal consequences; indeed, Hollywood will probably find a way to give her some new award or endorsement gig.

In the meantime, out west, Milo Yiannopoulos has also been the object of a “climate of violence.” And yet for their part, pressies have oscillated between yawning and cheering. A man was shot and critically wounded in Seattle, and still, the MSM didn’t much care, because, after all, the man seems to have been a Milo supporter.

And just a few days ago, at the University of California’s Berkeley campus, rioters shut down a Milo appearance. As Milo said afterward, the rioting “tells you something very, very clear about the left’s commitment to free expression.” It’s worth recalling that back in 1964, Berkeley was the hub of what was grandiosely dubbed, by students, as the “Free Speech Movement.” Now, 53 years later, the self-proclaimed guardians of the First Amendment have had no interest in upholding Milo’s constitutional right to free speech.

In fact, some on the left have gone the complete opposite way: toward fact-free ideological conspiracy-mongering. One such is UC Berkeley’s Robert Reich, the former Clinton cabinet secretary; Reich went on TV to accuse the right—and specifically, Breitbart—of causing the violence, as a provocation against the left. In other words, the whole fracas was Milo’s fault. Talk about blaming the victim!

Reich’s brand of fantastic projection was too much for Rush Limbaugh, who asked of his radio-show audience:

Do you know any right-wingers capable of this kind of behavior? I mean, go to Ferguson, go to Baltimore, go to San Bernardino, go to Watts. Take any protest, any violence. Go to Oakland any time you want. Any time there is violent protests, it’s always left-wingers bought and paid for by the Hillary campaign, the Democrat Party, or George Soros, and never once have the Democrats ever condemned them, ’cause they’re proud of them.

Yes, that is correct: Cutting-edge Democrats have never condemned the violent hooligans doing their dirty work, for one simple reason—they’re proud of them.

And even now, Reich continues to unapologetically—make that, eagerly—spew his crackpot conspiratorializing. Obviously Reich is a devotee of the Big Lie: that is, a falsehood, repeated often enough, equals truth. So never mind the fact that we have since learned that it was the anti-Milo protesters who were on someone’s payroll—George Soros’ payroll. (We might also observe, not that any of the local authorities seem to have noticed, that the fomenting—and financing—of violence is a crime.)

As Milo told Fox News’ Tucker Carlson, the left’s game plan is to claim that its opponents are nothing but racists, sexists, white nationalists, anti-Semites, and homophobes. And to make these charges, the left doesn’t need any evidence, only the accusations. Once again, that’s the Big Lie technique. And yet such fact-free slandering is just fine with the MSM, which then goes to work amplifying the accusations, thus amping up, yes, the “culture of violence.” As Milo said:

The media has created this environment in which it’s okay to say almost anything about somebody who is right of Jane Fonda. … And it’s a way of legitimizing, in some cases, as happened last night, violent responses.

And we might add, beyond Milo, Breitbart itself is increasingly the target. Virgil might add that the tactics being used are straight out of Saul Alinsky’s Rules for Radicals. All of Alinsky’s “rules” are being practiced today, but we can focus on Rule #11: “Pick the target, freeze it, personalize it, and polarize it.”

Breitbart is tough; we’re used to fights and fighting. This wasn’t a fight we began, but it is a fight we seek to win. And yet everyone on the populist-nationalist right ought to see the current situation clearly: The hard left has plenty of resources, and no scruples about deploying those resources. And so Breitbart is just one of many targets. And of course, if the left can attack us, well, Soros & Co. won’t stop there. They’ll be coming for you next.

So that’s the real context of the vast “climate of violence” conjured up by the left. It’s all part of a master plan—a plan for mastery. That is, smash the enemy, and then rearrange the pieces into a new left-wing order.

Yet in the meantime, we must remember the main target: President Trump. And so we can can step back and observe, with grim certainty, the dream scenario of some on the other side:

A weird and bloody kind of lefty-media glory awaits the person who takes to heart the message of that cover story in Village.

Pressure was building on House of Commons Speaker John Bercow Tuesday afternoon as an increasing number of MPs spoke out against his decision to effectively ban U.S. President Donald J. Trump from speaking to Parliament.

MPs have called the Speaker’s impartiality into question over his comments yesterday, accusing him of “grandstanding” and “hypocrisy”.

Responding to growing criticism, Mr Bercow told the House of Commons Tuesday afternoon he had acted “honestly and honourably” to “discharge my responsibilities to the House”.

“The House has always understood that the chair has a role in these matters,” he said.

However, Daniel Kawczynski, the MP for Shrewsbury, told Breitbart London he was “very disappointed and concerned by the Speaker’s comments, which have brought into question his judgement and impartiality”.

He added he was “surprised he has no qualms about hosting the Premier of China but has concerns over inviting the democratically elected leader of our closest ally and NATO partner”.

David TC Davies, MP for Monmouth, also told Breitbart London: “I have great respect for the Speaker, but it would be a great mistake not to invite Donald Trump to speak.

“The BBC and others seem to be trying to compare Trump to the leaders of repressive countries, but America has a great human rights record. I’d much rather be gay, a woman or a Muslim in the United States than in many other nations.

“We should respect our American allies.”

Former Culture Secretary John Whittingdale added that Mr Bercow’s comments were “damaging the national interest”, and accused the Speaker of “playing to the gallery for as much publicity as possible”.

Speaking in the House of Commons, Sir Gerald Howarth told the Speaker his comments had “caused some of us some concerns”.

“The Prime Minister, in the view of many of us, managed to secure a very favourable outcome of what was undoubtedly a very tricky visit [to see Mr Trump]. I do hope, Mr Speaker, that you will help us to ensure that we can have full confidence in your impartiality.”

The interventions came as Mr Bercow’s counterpart in the House of Lords slapped him down in a statement to the Upper Chamber, saying he was “not consulted” over the decision.

He added that while both he and Mr Bercow have the ability to “veto” such a visit, “before we reach this point there should be, at the very least, some effort to reach consensus and a serious discussion on what the decision should be”.

“I hope that we can now return to that previous practice.”

Actress Lena Dunham says the stress and “devastation” of Donald Trump’s election victory in November caused her to lose weight.

“Donald Trump became president and I stopped being able to eat food,” the 30-year-old Girls actress revealed during an interview on Howard Stern‘s radio show on Monday.

Dunham, one of Hillary Clinton’s most committed celebrity surrogates during the campaign, said her friends were asking what she was doing to lose the weight.

“Everyone’s been asking like, ‘What have you been doing?’ And I’m like, ‘Try soul-crushing pain and devastation and hopelessness and you, too, will lose weight,'” she explained.

“He said I was a B-list actor with no mojo,” she lamented, referencing Trump’s appearance on Fox and Friends last April where he called the actress a “B-actor” after the Golden Globe-winner promised to move to Canada if Trump won the White House.

Dunham, however, never moved to Canada and has nevertheless continued her left-wing brand of political activism in the months since the election.

After wishing last month that she had had an abortion on an episode of her podcast series, Dunham gave a “sizable donation to abortion funds” and Planned Parenthood.

Last month, Dunham got naked, jumped in a tub of water, and took to Twitter to encourage her followers to sign up for Obamacare before the January 31 enrollment deadline.

SAN PEDRO, Nuevo León– The recent arrest of one of the most wanted drug lords in this state could uncover a network of law enforcement and government officials who have been providing support to the Beltran Leyva Cartel.

The arrest in this city took place when 27-year-old Eleazar “El Cochi or Commander 19” Palomo Castillo tried to avoid a checkpoint set up by the Mexican Navy. Palomo is considered to be a regional boss for the Beltran Leyva cartel.

SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

According to information provided to Breitbart Texas by military authorities who took part in the arrest, Beltran Leyva’s Palomo Castillo took over the drug distribution networks in this city’s most exclusive areas such as Centrito Valle. The drug lord also managed to co-opt more than 20 municipal police officers in order to receive exact information about operations from the unified communications center, known as C4. During the past two years, the police force in the town of San Pedro has known about the presence of street level dealers run by El Cochi in nightclubs and luxurious businesses where students and the sons of rich businessmen go party on weekends.

After the arrest of El Cochi by federal authorities, investigators expect to be able to learn the names and codenames of local and state officers who received bribes in exchange for letting the drug lord operate in the area. In the past, authorities have publicly referred to San Pedro as the safest city in Mexico.

The information provided by authorities revealed that under his role as drug lord, El Cochi bribes police officers and ministerial cops to work in the kidnappings and extortion cases of rival criminals who tried to move in to his plaza in San Pedro.

El Cochi has been linked to the execution of Pedro Anuar Martinez, the son of the San Pedro police chief and Carlos Arturo Valle Novelo, the intelligence chief for the State Ministerial Police. The homicides took place after a luxurious watch went missing from a crime scene. The timepiece appears to have been stolen and not turned in as evidence to investigators.

In December 2015, Mexican marines in San Pedro arrested multiple suspected gunmen. Initial information pointed to El Cochi being among those arrested, but later proved inaccurate. Rumors have since spread that the drug lord was released after paying a bribe.

Editor’s Note: Breitbart Texas traveled to the Mexican States of Tamaulipas, Coahuila and Nuevo León to recruit citizen journalists willing to risk their lives and expose the cartels silencing their communities.

HOUSTON (AP) — Tom Brady doesn’t want to talk about “Deflategate.” He’d rather reflect on a night he will never forget and how much it meant to his mother.

The New England quarterback spoke Monday hours after he won his fifth Super Bowl ring and fourth MVP trophy. He called the 34-28 overtime victory over the Atlanta Falcons a “hell of a game” for his mother, who has been dealing with an undisclosed health issue and was not able to attend any other games this season.

“It was great. She’s been through a lot,” Brady said. “Way harder than I went through last night. Way harder than everyone on our team went through last night. My dad’s been there every step of the way. They set such a great example for me.

“All families go through challenging times personally. But she has a lot of support and a lot of love. I’m just happy last night to be able to celebrate with her.”

What was missing from the celebration was Brady’s game jersey, which he said disappeared in the locker room afterward and he still cannot find. But he joked that he expects to spot it soon in an online auction.

He would not say whether his fifth championship meant more to him than the others because of his four-game suspension stemming from the Deflategate scandal.

Coach Bill Belichick said it would be “inappropriate” to suggest that Brady put in more effort this season for any reason.

“To insinuate that this season was somehow different, that this year he competed harder or did anything to a higher degree than anything he has in the past I think is insulting to the tremendous effort and leadership and competitiveness that he’s shown for the 17 years that I’ve coached him,” Belichick said.

Brady had another uneventful interaction with NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell during a photo with the MVP trophy.

He said teammate James White was more deserving of the award because of his three touchdowns in Sunday’s win.

Two years ago, Brady gave the truck he received for winning MVP honors to Malcolm Butler for the rookie cornerback’s game-saving interception in the Patriots’ Super Bowl win over the Seahawks.

He hinted Monday that he may not keep the next vehicle either.

“I think James White deserves it. It would be nice for him,” Brady said. “It took a real team effort. … We faced a lot of adversity this year and overcame it with a lot of mental toughness.”

That said, he is definitely keeping the trophy.

When the news conference concluded, Brady looked down and grasped the silver football and cradled it under his arm as he walked off the stage.

“I’m taking it home,” Brady said.

The chairman of Poland’s ruling Law and Justice Party (PiS) wishes to forge an alliance of European Union (EU) member states opposed to taking punitive action against the United Kingdom in the upcoming Brexit negotiations.

In an interview with Peter Foster, The Daily Telegraph‘s Europe editor, Jarosław Kaczyński echoed the sentiments expressed by Prime Minister Beata Szydło in November 2016, when she wrote that “Poland stands ready to help its old friend Britain reach the best possible Brexit deal”.

Kaczyński, a former prime minister and twin brother to the late President Lech Kaczyński, is widely regarded as the power behind the thrones occupied by Szydło and President Andrzej Duda.

“Officially everyone loves the United Kingdom and doesn’t want to give them a hard time,” the veteran conservative told Foster. “But some people really want to make it as tough as possible for the United Kingdom.

“Meanwhile some of us would like to sustain a kind of partnership with the United Kingdom. Not within Europe – since you do not wish to remain inside – but very close and friendly relations from outside the European Union. Poland belongs to the second category of voices.”

Kaczyński’s party is a patriotic and socially conservative party, opposed to mass immigration, and committed to rooting out the surviving elements of the former Communist regime, to the great displeasure of the dominant powers in Brussels.

“On the one hand we need to stand up for our citizens, and this is what we will do,” he says. “But on the other hand, our ambition would be to create such conditions here to attract migrants back to Poland. If this policy is successful, of course it won’t happen overnight, but in the not too distant future this problem should come to a solution by itself.”

Kaczyński sees Brexit as an opportunity for the bloc to change course, becoming a free trade area where sovereign nation-states freely co-operate, rather than a bureaucratic federation.

“This would, of course, imply that much of the powers now invested in the Brussels-based bureaucracy would be restored to member-states,” he told The Telegraph. “It would bring us back close to the origin of the European Union, back to the European Economic Community (EEC), with rules that would make it difficult for any one nation to gain hegemony over others.”

This was a clear dig at Germany, the driving force behind the EU migrant crisis and chief beneficiary of the single currency. Kaczyński, however, believes that Germany lacks the requisite strength to succeed as a European hegemon, and is “much weaker” than the United Kingdom.

“Without attempting to deny that Germany is a very strong state, they are by far too weak to run this soft hegemony – an American-style hegemony,” he said. “[T]o have such a hegemony you need to be very strong in military terms and have an immense economic advantage over all other partners. Whereas Germany is not strong in military terms – much weaker than that the United Kingdom.”

The EU has responded to the eurosceptic, populist stance of Kaczyński and his party, which has promised to launch a “cultural counter-revolution” in Europe, by launching an unprecedented probe into democracy and the rule of law in the country. But the 67-year-old says his country is ready to see off its “post-colonial” interference.

“[W]hatever is happening in Poland right now, it doesn’t give grounds to say that democracy is at risk,” promising that the Slavic republic will “entirely” ignore any EU censures or sanctions when a deadline to adopt “corrective measures” runs out at the end of February 2017.

Kaczyński also echoed the prediction of Ted Malloch, tipped as President Donald J. Trump’s ambassador to the EU, that the euro could “collapse” within a year and a half.

“From the very inception of the common currency there were some prophets who said it was going to collapse one day”, Kaczyński noted. “That looks realistic now, it looks probable.”

European politicians were incensed when Professor Malloch made the same prediction, calling on the bloc’s leading bureaucrats to block his appointment as U.S. representative in Brussels.

“We should understand that Google… is intensely aligned with U.S. exceptionalism,” claimed Assange. “Personally at the top aligned with Hillary Clinton’s election campaign and almost certainly once Hillary Clinton becomes president, those people in Google, like Jared Cohen, will be placed into positions around the new Clinton presidency.”

TEL AVIV – A prominent U.S.-based Jewish human rights group slammed Amazon Germany’s promotion of a book entitled “The Rothschilds: A Family that Controls the World” as an “outrage.”

The Simon Wiesenthal Center’s France-based director for international relations, Dr. Shimon Samuels, said in a letter to Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos that promoting the “anti-Semitic” book was a violation of Amazon’s own regulations.

“This blood libel could have been drawn from the ravings of Hitler to the genocidal charter of Hamas.”

Samuels told Bezos, “For the last 12 years, we have monitored the Frankfurt Book Fair and their Arab counterparts, identifying books such as ‘The Rothschilds’ on the display stands. In most cases, the Frankfurt authorities will confiscate those we expose on grounds of violating the contract (and in many cases German law) between the publisher and the Fair — that contract explicitly prohibits fomenting hate and violence.”

Samuels went on to urge Bezos “to follow that principle, whether through Amazon.com, Amazon.de or any part of your constellation. Amazon must not serve as a fig leaf for conspiracy theories or defamatory incitement that endangers us all.”

The cover of the book features a shrouded figure plunging a dagger into a globe.

Actress Lena Dunham says the stress and “devastation” of Donald Trump’s election victory in November caused her to lose weight.

“Donald Trump became president and I stopped being able to eat food,” the 30-year-old Girls actress revealed during an interview on Howard Stern‘s radio show on Monday.

Dunham, one of Hillary Clinton’s most committed celebrity surrogates during the campaign, said her friends were asking what she was doing to lose the weight.

“Everyone’s been asking like, ‘What have you been doing?’ And I’m like, ‘Try soul-crushing pain and devastation and hopelessness and you, too, will lose weight,'” she explained.

“He said I was a B-list actor with no mojo,” she lamented, referencing Trump’s appearance on Fox and Friends last April where he called the actress a “B-actor” after the Golden Globe-winner promised to move to Canada if Trump won the White House.

Dunham, however, never moved to Canada and has nevertheless continued her left-wing brand of political activism in the months since the election.

After wishing last month that she had had an abortion on an episode of her podcast series, Dunham gave a “sizable donation to abortion funds” and Planned Parenthood.

Last month, Dunham got naked, jumped in a tub of water, and took to Twitter to encourage her followers to sign up for Obamacare before the January 31 enrollment deadline.

Rosie O’Donnell says she’s more than willing to play White House chief strategist and former Breitbart News executive chairman Steve Bannon on Saturday Night Live.

O’Donnell, who has had a decade-long public feud with President Donald Trump, was asked by a Twitter user if she would “take one for the team” and spoof Bannon following Melissa McCarthy’s turn on SNL as White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer.

“I am here to serve,” O’Donnell responded. “Alec has trump – melissa has spice – i would need a few days to prepare – so if called – i will be ready.”

@calvininsf – i am here to serve – alec has trump – melissa has spice – i would need a few days to prepare – so if called – i will be ready — ROSIE (@Rosie) February 7, 2017

If granted the opportunity to play Bannon, O’Donnell would join McCarthy as Spicer and Alec Baldwin, who has spent the better of a year lampooning Trump on the long-running sketch comedy show. Politico, citing anonymous sources, reported this week that the depiction of a woman (McCarthy) playing Trump’s male press secretary had “rattled” the White House.

O’Donnell’s public criticism of Trump has intensified over much of the past year and at one point even spilled over to another member of his family.

Shortly after Trump’s election victory, the former View co-host shared a video on social media that questioned whether or not Trump’s youngest son, Barron, was autistic. After initially defending asking the question, O’Donnell eventually apologized to Melania Trump for attacking the 10-year-old. But before long, the 54-year comedienne had reset her sights on President Trump.

Three weeks before Trump’s inauguration, O’Donnell took to Twitter and proclaimed to her 900,000-plus Twitter followers that they had “less than 3 weeks to stop” Trump from taking office. A few days later, she went so far as to call for martial law to delay Trump’s inauguration.

Saturday Night Live had been extremely critical of Trump during the presidential campaign, and even more critical of his administration once he won. Baldwin’s latest turn on SNL as President Trump saw the actor being joined by another actor playing Bannon, who was dressed as the Grim Reaper.

President Trump has previously called the NBC show “one-sided” and “not funny.”

Two previously deported sex offenders were apprehended by Border Patrol agents shortly after they illegally reentered the U.S. from Mexico on Thursday morning. Border Patrol officials stated the arrest illustrates the importance of knowing who is crossing our borders.

Agents assigned to the Calexico Station observed two men walking north from the Mexican International Border fence near the town of Ocotillo. The agents approached the two men and learned the Mexican nationals had just entered the country illegally, information obtained by Breitbart Texas from U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) revealed.

SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

The mountainous region is a known area for illegal border crossers to attempt to enter the U.S.

The two Mexican nationals were transported by Border Patrol agents to the El Centro Station for processing. During a routine background check, agents learned the two men had both been convicted for sex crimes against minors by the State of Nevada, CBP officials reported.

One of the men, a 26-year-old Mexican national, was convicted for Lewdness Acts with a Minor, officials stated. He received a 5 year prison sentence for the crime and was deported following his release from prison.

The second man, a 24-year-old Mexican national, was also convicted in Nevada on a charge of Lewd and Lascivious Act with a Minor, the CBP report stated. He was sentenced to two to five years in prison and was subsequently deported.

The dates of the crimes were not revealed by CBP officials. They also did not reveal if the two crimes were in any way connected or if the two suspects were related.

“These two arrests highlight the importance of knowing who is coming into the United States,” El Centro Sector Assistant Chief Patrol Agent David S. Kim said in a written statement. “The two sex offenders our Border Patrol Agents arrested took advantage of and preyed on minors. Our agents shield our communities and our country from threats like this every day.”

Both suspects will be prosecuted for illegal Reentry After Removal as convicted sex offenders.

El Centro Sector agents have successfully prevented four previously deported sex offenders from completing their mission to illegally reenter the U.S. during this fiscal year which began on October 1, 2016, the CBP reported.

Just last week, a 33-year-old Mexican national was arrested by agents from this same sector having illegally crossed the International Border fence near the Calexico Gran Plaza Outlets. This suspect had been previously convicted as a sex offender by the State of California. He was deported following his conviction, Breitbart Texas’ John Binder reported.

The other previously deported sex offender was busted on October 11, 2016 by Border Patrol agents in the El Centro Sector. A records check revealed the 37-year-old Mexican national was deported in 2002 after being convicted for having sex with a minor under the age of three. The State of California only sentenced the man to 162 days in jail. He was subsequently deported.

Breitbart Texas has reported extensively on the numbers of previously deported sex offenders captured by Border Patrol agents working in other sectors along our nation’s borders.

The Task Force on Diversity at all women’s university Barnard College has released draft recommendations for the school that include hiring a Chief Diversity Officer and social justice workshops.

In a draft proposal on “three action areas that we believe have the potential to transform the College into a more representative, inclusive and equitable campus,” the group’s first recommendation is for the school to “create a position for a Chief Diversity Officer (CDO) with a campus-wide and community-focused mandate.”

SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

An experienced CDO will prioritize and focus on diversity and inclusion initiatives and institutional continuity over time; re-conceptualize diversity and inclusion as a strength/priority; institute a leadership and accountability structure for Barnard’s diversity mission; and provide necessary expertise in managing change relative to diversity and inclusion. The CDO will lead a collaborative team comprised of staff and faculty who are already working on diversity and inclusion across the campus, along with others whose work is relevant to this aspect of the College’s mission. A newly established Diversity Council that represents all campus constituencies will serve in an advisory capacity. Creating this role signals importance of diversity and inclusion to the entire Barnard community, including students, alumnae, faculty, administrators, and staff.

The plan also calls for the university to hire ten professors from underrepresented groups by 2022. Barnard administrators claim that “diverse student bodies and diverse faculties” lead to “better learning outcomes and campus climate, [and] enhanced support for underrepresented students and faculty.”

In addition to the hiring initiative, the task force wants Barnard to hold required workshops on “inclusion and equity” for students. Organizers claim that these will “create a shared understanding of the distinctive challenges facing … historically underrepresented groups.”

“Such initiatives create a true community-wide conversation about the value of diversity and will promote a sense of community and cohesion among all members of Barnard community,” it claims.

CIUDAD VICTORIA, Tamaulipas — A key leader within the Los Zetas cartel was murdered inside the state prison in this city by members of a rival faction of the same cartel. That Zeta commander had been arrested this week in a house tied to the former State Security System.

The Tamaulipas Government confirmed to Breitbart Texas that 37-year-old Jose Luis “Comandante Cano” Cano Lumbreras was murdered inside the prison. Cano was returning to his cell from a court hearing when he was attacked by a group of inmates and asphyxiated.

SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Tamaulipas authorities had arrested Cano three days prior to his murder while carrying out an anti-kidnapping operation, Breitbart Texas reported. Cano had been leading a group of Los Zetas gunmen who were behind a rash of kidnappings and executions in the city.

Ciudad Victoria has been ground zero for a fierce turf war between rival factions of the Los Zetas cartel, Breitbart Texas has reported extensively on the ongoing fighting. Initially the faction known as Cartel Del Noreste fought against the alliance made up of Grupo Bravo and Vieja Escuela Z (CDZ). The two allies have recently turned on each other leading to a three way fight for control. The fighting has resulted in almost daily kidnappings, drive by shootings, gun battles, and gory executions.

Soon after Cano’s arrest, Mexico’s Proceso Magazine reported the house where the arrest was carried out was the home of the sister of one of the top former security officials in Tamaulipas. According to the Mexican publication, the house where Cano was found in belonged to the sister of Armando Nuñez Montelongo, the former secretary of the state security system. The former public official was linked in the publication as having been a link between state government officials and Mexican drug cartels.

As Breitbart Texas reported, Tamaulipas is under the control of a new administration from a rival political party that has been uncovering multiple acts of corruption by previous administrations all tied to the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI). Tamaulipas is the state where two former PRI governors are current fugitives of the U.S. Department of Justice. The two men are wanted on money laundering charges in connection with taking bribes from cartel members.

Editor’s Note: Breitbart Texas traveled to the Mexican States of Tamaulipas, Coahuila and Nuevo León to recruit citizen journalists willing to risk their lives and expose the cartels silencing their communities. The writers would face certain death at the hands of the various cartels that operate in those areas including the Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas if a pseudonym were not used.

The story reported that Trump was struggling being “cloistered” inside the White House, and that his senior aides were having difficulty adjusting to their new roles in the White House — and to each other.

But Spicer accused the reporters of getting the story horribly wrong, calling it “literally the epitome of fake news.”

“That story was so riddled with inaccuracies and lies that they owe the president an apology,” he said. “Literally blatant factual errors and it’s unacceptable to see that kind of reporting or so-called reporting.”

Spicer accused the New York Times reporters of failing their readers by printing unsubstantiated rumors.

“From top to bottom it made up stories that don’t exist and I think that’s unfortunate for people that look to news institutions like that for their news,” he said.

San Francisco (AFP) – YouTube on Tuesday began letting popular online video personalities broadcast on the go using mobile devices, ramping up a challenge to Facebook and Twitter in the live-streaming arena.

SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Google-owned YouTube has supported live streaming of video through computers for about six years, even broadcasting US presidential debates online.

The new mobile live streaming feature allows YouTube content creators whose channels have more than 10,000 subscribers to broadcast through apps tailored for mobile devices such as smartphones, according to product managers Barbara Macdonald and Kurt Wilms.

“It’s a launch that’ll put the power of live streaming in the hands of hundreds of thousands of talented creators, giving them a more intimate and spontaneous way to share their thoughts, lives and creativity,” Macdonald and Wilms said in a blog post.

They promised that the feature would be available more broadly at YouTube soon.

Leading social network Facebook and one-to-many messaging service Twitter have already added such capabilities to their mobile applications, getting a jump on YouTube.

YouTube added a financial incentive in the form of a “Super Chat” tool that lets online video stars make money from fans willing to pay to “stand out from the crowd” by having their chat messages highlighted in bright colors and pinned to the top of text conversation boxes for creators to see.

“Super Chat is like paying for that front-row seat in the digital age,” Macdonald and Wilms said.

In December, Facebook began testing a live audio streaming service that will let people essentially broadcast radio-style on the leading online social network.

The new feature came as an alternative to a Facebook Live tool that lets people stream live video at the social network.

An audio-streaming option promised to be useful in areas where telecommunication networks have trouble handling the larger data demands of video streaming.

President Obama and his minions, who refused to believe that increasing U.S. oil production would drive the price of gas into the ground, are now eating oily crow.

Remember when President Obama mocked the call to “drill, baby, drill” as nothing more than “a slogan, a gimmick, and a bumper sticker … not a strategy.”

SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Well, as his friend and pastor, Jeremiah Wright, would say, “Obama’s petroleum drilling chickens have come home to roost.”

As Fox News reports:

Today, Democrats are singing a different tune, as increased domestic drilling has led to a record supply of domestic crude, put some $100 billion into the pockets of U.S. consumers and sent world oil prices tumbling. The price of a gallon of regular gasoline on Monday was $2.13 nationwide, and below $2 in 18 states. …. Most of the domestic increase is due to “fracking” for tight oil in shale deposits across the U.S., as well as advances in directional drilling, where numerous pipelines diverge from a single platform in numerous directions, for a large cost savings. But the gains, according to oil experts, come off private, not federal, lands.

Can you imagine how much lower the price of oil would drop if Obama would allow oil drilling on federal land?

Now Obama, as always, is trying to take credit for the drop in gas, which is saving Americans tens of millions of dollars.

Fox points out that President Obama declared in Detroit last week, “America is the number one producer of oil, number one producer of gas. It’s helping to save drivers $1.10 a gallon at the pump over this time last year.”

Meanwhile, oil production on federal lands — those under the President’s control — fell six percent since 2009, according to the federal Energy Information Administration, while production on private lands increased 61 percent.

Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY), a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, will oppose Elliott Abrams if President Donald Trump nominates him to serve as the Deputy Secretary of State, a senior aide to Paul confirmed to Breitbart News late Monday night.

Paul’s decision to come out against Abrams strikes a damaging blow against his chances of ever receiving Senate confirmation should he be nominated, outside of bipartisan support that he’s unlikely to receive or a full-court press by Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman Sen. Bob Corker (R-TN) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.

SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

With 21 members—11 Republicans and 10 Democrats—if the Democrats on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee hold strong against Abrams should Trump select him, Paul’s vote would be the deciding vote and he would fail in Committee. His decision to oppose Abrams per a senior aide puts the kibosh on Abrams’ chances once and for all, unless a Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee comes out for him–or unless McConnell and Corker try to bring him up straight on the Senate floor despite failing in Committee, something a senior Senate aide tells Breitbart News is not usually done.

Given how difficult Paul’s decision here would make it to get Abrams through the Senate to confirmation should he be nominated, it’s unclear if Trump and his White House would want to go to such lengths to fight for someone who disagrees with the president on so many core policy visions. Abrams does not believe in an “America First” foreign policy vision, is from a wing of the GOP that Trump regularly criticizes, and has significant disagreements with Trump’s stated vision on core matters like the Middle East and the Arab Spring.

Paul’s efforts, a senior aide adds, are meant to be constructive. Since Abrams’ policy viewpoints don’t match Trump’s vision for foreign policy, Paul believes that Trump should turn to someone else. Paul will make this argument, and officially make his announcement against Abrams, in an op-ed that will be published on Tuesday.

“In a country of 300 million people, surely there are reasonable foreign policy experts who have not been convicted of deceiving Congress and actually share the President’s foreign policy views,” Paul writes in an excerpt of the op-ed that will run in Rare, obtained by Breitbart News ahead of its release.

The fact Abrams is even being considered for the slot is baffling to many Trump supporters, given that he was aiding the “Never Trump” movement inside the Republican Party—and that he has a foreign policy worldview much more in line with the political dynasties Trump crushed on his way to the White House, the Bushes and the Clintons.

“Elliott Abrams, a neoconservative who has long argued for an activist foreign policy that spreads American values around the world, was advising Republicans just last spring to ‘keep your distance’ from Donald J. Trump and offering advice about what the party should do after the ‘Trump collapse,’” the New York Times’ Gardiner Harris and David E. Sanger wrote on Monday night.

Nonetheless, Abrams has a meeting scheduled on Tuesday at the White House with President Trump to interview for the number two position in the State Department.

The Times reports that Abrams is known in foreign policy circles as “controversial,” but his conviction over misleading Congress in connection with the Iran-Contra scandal from the Ronald Reagan administration “deeply understates the case.” Abrams was later pardoned by Reagan’s successor in the White House.

“He is remembered best for the days when he was an assistant secretary of state during the Reagan administration, and his conviction in 1991 on two misdemeanor counts of withholding information from Congress during the Iran-contra affair,” Harris and Sanger wrote. “He was later pardoned by President George Bush, and that moment has largely receded from memory — although if he is nominated, there is little question that Democrats will bring it up again.”

Before the Republican National Convention in Cleveland in July, the National Interest’s Daniel DePetris noted in a recent piece, Abrams pushed for Republicans to challenge Trump head on at the convention where he would be chosen as the GOP nominee for president.

“Do not allow the Republican convention to be a coronation wherein Trump and Trumpism are unchallenged,” Abrams said, urging the Never Trump movement to challenge him on the floor of the convention. “There’s no reason others who won many delegates, from Rubio to Cruz to Kasich, should not have their names put in nomination. The party needs to be reminded that there are deep divisions, and Trump needs to be reminded of how many in the party oppose and even fear his nomination.”

Abrams also called for Republicans to “seize the party machinery back” from conservatives and grassroots Trump supporters “immediately after the Trump defeat” by Hillary Rodham Clinton, something the man President Trump is now considering for the second highest diplomatic post in his administration said was inevitable, but which turned out not to happen.

P.J. Media’s David Goldman writes that selecting Abrams would be like picking an “arsonist” to serve as a town’s “fire chief.” While Goldman understands that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson may need an experienced diplomat to help run the State Department and “has few good choices,” picking Abrams would be a mistake.

“Bringing the Bush Utopians back into the picture, though, would be a cure far worse than the disease,” Goldman wrote. “During the campaign, Abrams made clear that he would rather see his party fail than see Donald Trump succeed. Inside the administration, Abrams would have the opportunity to make this happen. Arsonists may have great experience with fires, but that doesn’t qualify them to become the captain of the fire brigade.”

Now, with Rand Paul coming out against Abrams preemptively—before Abrams even meets with the president on Tuesday—he may be saving the movement the trouble of a fight.

As you know, I’m very much opposed to sanctuary cities. They breed crime, there’s a lot of problems. If we have to, we’ll defund. We give tremendous amounts of money to California. California in many ways is out of control as you know.

O’Reilly pressed Trump, asking if defunding have become his “weapon of choice?”

Trump was careful to define defunding as one weapon, but added, “I don’t want to defund a state or a city. I don’t want to defund anybody. I want to give them the money they need to properly operate as a city or a state. If they’re going to have sanctuary cities, we may have to do that. Certainly that would be a weapon.”

On Tuesday State Senate President Pro Tem Kevin de León declared that “half” of his family were in the United States illegally as he spoke in favor of his bill, SB54, which would make California a full-blown sanctuary state.

In a Wednesday interview with KPCC 89.3’s Air Talk with Larry Mantle, De Léon blasted President Trump while confirming that he did not believe illegal aliens should be deported for using fraudulent Social Security cards and numbers.

De Léon added, “…the vast majority of immigrants — hard-working immigrants — have done that. I can tell you I have family members specifically who came here as undocumented immigrants, and they did the same thing. That’s what you need to do to survive in this economy.”

De Léon deflected when asked about Americans who have their identities stolen for the purpose of being sold to illegal aliens.

LONDON (AP) — Lawyers for a British Royal Marine commando on Tuesday asked a court to overturn his murder conviction for killing a wounded Taliban fighter in Afghanistan, arguing that mental health problems mean he wasn’t fully responsible for his actions.

Sgt. Alexander Blackman was sentenced to a minimum of 10 years by a military court in 2013 for the September 2011 killing in Helmand Province.

Footage from another marine’s helmet camera showed Blackman shooting the militant in the chest at close range, then saying: “Obviously this doesn’t go anywhere, fellas. I just broke the Geneva Convention.”

Last year, a review commission granted Blackman an appeal, citing new evidence about his mental health.

Blackman’s lawyer, Jonathan Goldberg, told the Courts Martial Appeal Court that conditions in Helmand in 2011, with British troops coming under frequent insurgent attack, were a “breeding ground” for mental health problems.

As Blackman watched proceedings by video-link from prison, Goldberg said that three experts agreed that Blackman had been suffering from a recognized mental illness — an adjustment disorder, which impaired his ability to form a rational judgment or exercise self-control.

Goldberg said that Blackman was a reserved “John Wayne character” who had “mental scars” after narrowly escaping death in a grenade attack and suffering the loss of a close comrade.

“Only those who have been on the front line can know what it is really like,” he told the judges.

TEL AVIV – Some supporters of the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement against Israel are not even aware that their campaign is anti-Semitic and has its roots in Nazism, famed French intellectual and author Bernard-Henri Lévy told CNN Sunday.

“I want to say to the sincere followers of this BDS campaign, I want to tell them from the bottom of my heart, because I’m not sure they know it, this is an anti-Semitic campaign,” Lévy said on Fareed Zakaria’s “GPS” program. “This BDS campaign takes its roots a long time ago, 60 years ago, in the fringes of the dying Nazism.”

“The first time when boycott was recommended against Israel … was by Nazis escaping Germany, taking shelter in Iraq or in Syria and building this campaign of BDS,” Lévy said.

“BDS exists all over the world but has so much strength also on the West Coast of America,” he continued. “This tide of anti-Semitism, alas, is not reserved to my country [France], it is much more worldwide.”

Lévy mentioned the debate currently taking place in France about whether Jews should leave the country because of the rise in anti-Semitism. He praises Jews as having played an integral role in the cultivation of French political and cultural life. He said, “Those who have to leave [France] are the anti-Semites who want nothing except to debuild [sic] and destroy this country. They will leave before I leave, for sure.”

“The Jews in the world are strong; strong in values, strong because of their memory, strong because [of] their habit of study. This gives an incredible strength which is stronger than the anti-Semites,” he said.

Lévy, whose most recent book is The Genius of Judaism, said last month that “Anti-Zionism is the new dressing for the old passion of antisemitism. … If you are anti-Zionist, that means you wish for a huge disaster for the Jewish people.”

Police in northern Germany have been forced to apologise after a draft email suggesting migrants should be kept away from carnival celebrations was leaked to migrant organisations, prompting accusations of racism.

Over the last few years, it has become common for the managers of residential homes for asylum seekers to take the migrants to carnivals to help familiarise them with German culture.

SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

But an email by North Rhine-Westphalia state police, addressed to the shelters’ managers, suggested that the practice be put on hold for the safety of the migrants themselves.

In light of the recent terrorist attacks in Europe, including that on Berlin’s Christmas market in December, the police were concerned that the public would react to the presence of groups of migrants with alarm.

“Due to events . . . of the last two years, this could unfortunately lead to undesired reactions,” the email said, according to a report in The Times.

The email also suggested the managers advise migrants to “undergo police searches without complaint”.

A police spokesman confirmed the draft was genuine, but said it had been criticised internally and a decision was taken not to send it.

Nonetheless, copies were leaked to several migrant organisations and charities who have reacted angrily, accusing the police of racism.

Petra Jennen, who works at the central migrant centre in Leverkusen, told the Kölner Stadt Anzeiger: “I won’t be telling the families we have living here that they can’t go to the carnival parade.”

She added that the request for migrants to undergo checks is “very unfair”, saying: “They would never think of making the same request to a German citizen.”

The Cologne Refugee Council, a group of migrant aid organisations, accused police of provoking hostility to migrants and called upon local people to defend migrants from the police.

“The carnival offers the best opportunities to integrate refugees,” it said. “Dear huns and hussars, dear costumed revellers and backpack wearers: Watch out! If you see your neighbour being checked just because they look ‘different’, intervene and ask why!”

The police have now apologised, with a spokesman saying: “The wording in this letter is ostracising. The impression is that immigrants should not attend carnival events.”

Much of Germany will be brought to a standstill this month when six days of parades and balls kick off, culminating on February 27 in Rose Monday processions in Cologne, Düsseldorf, and Mainz.

Security has been tight in Cologne since the New Year’s Eve 2015/16 attack which saw hundreds of girls molested by migrants in the city centre.

Sigrid Krebs, a spokesman for the Cologne Carnival Festival, said: “Everyone is very welcome at the Cologne carnival.”

*AUTHORS: ['Donna Rachel Edmunds']

Muslims outnumber Christian pupils in more than 30 church schools nationwide, including one which proudly proclaims to have a “100 per cent Muslim population”.

The Church of England has estimated that around 20 of its schools have more Muslim than Christian background pupils, while according to the Catholic Education Service, about 15 Catholic schools said the same.

St. Thomas in Werneth, Oldham, has no Christian pupils according to its website, although the Rev Nick Andrewes, who chairs the school’s governors says that figure is “a little out of date”. While 98 per cent of pupils attending Staincliffe C of E Junior School in Batley, West Yorkshire, “come from a Muslim background”, according to its most recent religious inspection report in 2015.

The Rev Nigel Genders, the Church of England’s chief education officer, has told The Times that at Bishop Bridgeman C of E Primary School in Bolton, 90 per cent of pupils were Muslim.

He added: “Yet it feels like a Church of England school.”

He said: “It goes back to the principle that we are not faith schools serving a Christian population but church schools serving the local community.”

Although it is a requirement for both Catholic and CofE schools, which receive government funding, to have a daily act of collective worship that is recognisably Christian, many of the schools appear to be accommodating both Christian and Muslim practices.

Some have incorporated Islamic prayers into their worship acts and allow girls to wear headscarves as part of the official uniform.

All Saints Church of England Primary in Bradford sells hijabs to its pupils.

The website for St. Thomas’ school notes that the school observes “both Christian and Muslim festivals”, while Staincliffe holds shared assembly services with an imam and a parish priest, referred to as the “men in black”, each term.

Their Remembrance Day service includes Islamic as well as Christian prayers, and the school schedules staff training days to coincide with the Islamic festival Eid to improve its attendance ratings, because most Muslim pupils would expect not to attend on those days.

Staincliffe’s website gives its motto as “one team together”, and says it is proud to be “cohesive, inclusive and caring” and “a church school serving a majority Muslim community”.

Education experts have suggested that the schools be turned into secular schools to avoid pupils becoming confused.

Professor Alan Smithers, director of the centre for education at the University of Buckingham, said: “The Church of England has traditionally provided education in this country but now that risks being an uncomfortable experience for the Muslim pupils that fill many of these schools.

“It must also be very confusing for the handful of Christian pupils in some of them. It would seem logical these schools become secular institutions.”

A sizzling residential real estate market fueled by incoming Californians, low supply, high demand, flat salaries, and local property taxes are pricing people out of homeownership in Austin.

Home prices have jumped faster in Austin than anywhere else the country, according to KVUE. They profiled a young Austin couple, Joi and Fabio Torres, who thought they did everything right to become homeowners, only the dream of homeownership remains elusive.

SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

“I’d gone to college, got my masters, we saved money, we had extra jobs. I thought we’ll just save a down payment and we’ll buy a house in Austin like we intended,” said Joi Torres who acknowledged that they had to choose between buying a home or having a baby. They had a baby. Her husband Fabio, a home remodeler, called Austin home prices ridiculous. “There were houses that were gutted that they wanted $200,000 for,” he said.

The Texas A&M Real Estate Center examined the Austin local market area (LMA) over five years. In January 2011, the Austin-Georgetown-Round Rock area median home prices were $199,700. By January 2015, that median hovered at $287,000. At the end of 2016, university real estate analysts found the home mid-price point at $332,000.

The real estate analysts also charted home prices in the larger Austin-Round Rock Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA), reflecting parallel price spikes beginning in 2014. By June 2016, the median was $290,000 although the market cooled slightly in December, lowering the median to $287,000.

Breitbart Texas reported Californians make up the largest number of Texas transplants based on figures from the Texas Association of Realtors’ 2017 Texas Relocation Report. The study accounted for a net gain of 16,890 new Austinites from other U.S. states; of them, 2,551 came from the Los Angeles metro area. Culture Map Austin estimated roughly 15,000 Californians transplanted to the Austin metro area between 2010-14. The Austin-Round Rock (MSA) crossed the 2 million population mark by 2015.

Experts say this influx drove up housing prices since Californians, who often cashed out on selling homes in over-inflated real estate markets, then paid outright for houses in the high-tech hub. Often, locals cannot compete. However, Brandy Guthrie, president of the Austin Board of Realtors and a lifelong Austin resident, also attributes stagnant salaries and flat pay raises to the problem.

“We do need to get proactive about wages and salaries if we want to continue to have the community we have here in Austin,” she told KVUE, which noted over the past quarter-century, household incomes increased 97 percent while median home prices leaped 290 percent.

This problem extends beyond Austin. Breitbart Texas reported on the off-kilter affordability equation in the 2015 Dallas-Fort Worth housing market. Dallasites could not keep up with soaring home prices impacted by transplants, insufficient new builds, and low inventory for sale.

KVUE suggested if salaries ran commensurate with Austin’s median home prices, a typical Austin family would earn around $153,000 per year. Figures from the Austin Neighborhood Housing and Development Office illustrate the gap, recording $77,800 as the actual 2016 Austin-Round Rock median annual four-person household family income.

Property appraisal values also exacerbate the housing crunch, often pushing Austinites outside city limits. KVUE found the five fastest-selling zip codes in the surrounding suburbs.

Austin Mayor Steve Adler worried Austin would become like San Francisco “where the average house price is $1,150,000 and only the well-to-do and those being subsidized can live. Nothing in-between. No middle class, no working class, no creatives and artists,” he said in a recent State of the City speech.

San Francisco ranked ninth on a list of least affordable housing markets in the world; Austin tied for 216th, according to Culture Map Austin.

Adler noted the current median price of an Austin home is $284,000 and believes the Austin market is cooling off, for now. “Experts tell us that 95,000 people are going to move to Austin by 2020,” he added.

The mayor also blamed “convoluted” and “confusing” land development codes that impede business development, plus a lack of tools to manage growth. Adler believes Austin must build at least 135,000 new housing units over the next 10 years to stabilize these prices and bridge the supply and demand gap. Low inventory and high demand can trigger bidding wars, raising home prices as well.

On Friday, U-Haul named Texas the number one U.S. growth state for 2016. Texas arrivals outpaced departures 50.8 to 49.2 percent largely because of relocations to Austin, the number two U.S. growth city in the 50,000-plus population category.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Charter school advocate Betsy DeVos won confirmation as U.S. Education secretary Tuesday by the slimmest of margins, pushed to approval only by the historic tie-breaking vote of Vice President Mike Pence.

SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Two Republicans, Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, joined Democrats in a marathon effort to derail the nomination of the wealthy Republican donor. The Senate historian said Pence’s vote was the first by a vice president to break a 50-50 tie on a Cabinet nomination.

Despite the win, DeVos emerged bruised from the highly divisive nomination fight. Opposed by half the Senate, she faced criticism, even ridicule for lack of experience and confusion during her confirmation hearing. At one point, she said some schools should have guns because of the threat of grizzly bears.

And there has been scathing opposition from teachers unions and civil rights activists over her support of charter schools and her conservative religious ideology.

President Donald Trump accused Democrats of seeking to torpedo education progress. In a tweet before the vote, he wrote, “Betsy DeVos is a reformer, and she is going to be a great Education Sec. for our kids!” Pence tweeted later in the day that supporting DeVos was “a vote for every child having a chance at a world-class education.”

She now takes the helm of a department charged with implementing laws affecting the nation’s public schools with no direct experience with traditional public schools. Her opponents noted that she has no experience running public schools, nor has she attended one or sent her children to one

She also will have to address several hot-button issues in higher education, such as rising tuition costs, growing student debt and the troubled for-profit colleges, many of which have closed down, leaving students with huge loans and without a good education or job prospects.

Close attention also will be paid to how DeVos deals with sexual assault and freedom of speech on campuses.

Ahead of Tuesday’s vote, emotions ran high as constituents jammed senators’ phone lines. Protesters gathered outside the Capitol, including one person in a grizzly bear costume to ridicule DeVos.

Democrats and labor unions vigorously fought the nomination, suggesting that DeVos would defund traditional public schools by diverting taxpayers’ money to charter and private institutions. They cited her financial interest in organizations pushing for charter schools, though she has said she will divest those interests.

Collins and Murkowski said they feared her focus on charter schools will undermine remote public schools in their states.

“President Trump’s swamp got a new billionaire today,” the Democratic National Committee said in a statement. “Millions of teachers, parents and students could not have made their opposition to Betsy DeVos’ confirmation any clearer — they do not want someone whose only education experience is dismantling public schools.”

DeVos supporters, however, saw her confirmation as an occasion to breathe new life into a troubled American school system and a chance to shift power from Washington to the local level.

“She has been a leader in the movement for public charter schools — the most successful reform of public education during the last 30 years,” said Sen. Lamar Alexander, the chairman of the Education Committee. “And she has worked tirelessly to help low-income children have more choices of better schools.”

DeVos has her work cut out.

“She will have to make it a priority to reach out to educators and education policy makers to reassure them that she is committed to working to improve education for all students including the vast majority who attend and will continue to attend traditional public schools,” said Martin West, associate professor of education at Harvard University. “My view is that she is committed to doing that.”

In addition to DeVos, Republicans hope to confirm a series of other divisive nominees this week: Alabama Republican Sen. Jeff Sessions as attorney general, GOP Rep. Tom Price of Georgia as health secretary and financier Steven Mnuchin as treasury secretary.

During the Fox News interview before the Super Bowl, Trump said that he had “respect” for Putin.

“Well, I respect a lot of people, but that doesn’t mean I’m going to get along with him. He’s a leader of his country,” he said. “I say it’s better to get along with Russia than not.”

O’Reilly repeatedly called Putin “a killer,” suggesting to Trump that he should distance himself.

“There are a lot of killers. We’ve got a lot of killers,” Trump replied, citing the Iraq War. “What do you think — our country’s so innocent? You think our country’s so innocent?”

*AUTHORS: ['John Sexton']
*ARTICLE: SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

In the wake of the hostage taking in Sydney Australia, Vox‘s Max Fisher says it’s time to stop asking Muslims to condemn terrorism. Fisher calls the practice of giving space to Muslim leaders space to comment after a violent incident, “Islamophobic and bigoted.” But is this really any different than what the progressive media routinely does after a violent crime?

This expectation we place on Muslims, to be absolutely clear, is Islamophobic and bigoted. The denunciation is a form of apology: an apology for Islam and for Muslims. The implication is that every Muslim is under suspicion of being sympathetic to terrorism unless he or she explicitly says otherwise. Theimplication is also that any crime committed by a Muslim is the responsibility of all Muslims simply by virtue of their shared religion. This sort of thinking — blaming an entire group for the actions of a few individuals, assuming the worst about a person just because of theiridentity — is the very definition of bigotry. SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Considering the scope of the claim Fisher is making he doesn’t spend much time establishing it as a significant problem. In fact, he only links one example of the kind of bigotry he has in mind. It’s a story headlined “Muslim community ‘shocked’ by Sydney cafe siege, say ‘misguided’ individuals misrepresenting faith.” It seems like an odd choice as an example of bigotry for a couple of reasons.

First, the story is written by Mohamed Taha, a writer/producer for ABC Australia. I reached out to Taha to ask about his background and what he thought of his work being labeled “Islamophobia” but he did not respond in time to be included in this story. That said, if Fisher wanted to pick one story to represent the bigotry he perceives in the media, perhaps he should have picked one not written by a writer named Mohamed.

Second, the story itself quotes Aftab Malik, a member of the UN Alliance of Civilizations, saying, “My reaction is one of shock, horror, aversion and of deep concern.” According to its website, the UN Alliance of Civilizations exists to promote “intercultural dialogue” via “direct public statements or appearances.” It was formed in 2005 after a series of high profile terrorist bombings like the 9/11 attack in the U.S. and the attack on London on 7/7. It’s whole purpose is to, “to improve understanding and cooperative relations among nations and peoples across cultures and religions — in particular, between the so called Western and Muslim societies.” In other words, commenting for news stories after an incident like the hostage situation in Sydney is precisely why the Alliance exists.

So before we move on it’s worth pointing out that the author of the piece (presumably at least) and the person commenting with the imprimatur of the UN do not seem to see the questions as bigoted or Islamophobic. Maybe there are other examples Fisher could point to but he failed to do so and thus failed to really make his case.

But there is another way to look at this and that’s the sheer hypocrisy of someone in the progressive media complaining about connecting innocent masses of people to violence. If we step back a bit, it’s not hard to think of many similar circumstances in which organizations, especially conservative ones, are expected to answer for violent incidents that arise in the news. After an abortionist is shot, for instance, the media immediately asks pro-life groups for comment. Are all pro-life Americans involved in every act of violence connected to their beliefs? Of course not. But the media still asks the question.

After a mass shooting in Tucson we were told it was time for a national discussion on violent rhetoric in politics. Progressive voices were viciously eager to connect the violence to Sarah Palin’spolitical district map which featured what looked like crosshairs. They completely ignored similar maps featuring bullseyes created by Democrats. The media also ignored the death wishes and assassination fantasies spewing from angry progressives toward Palin.

The President used the memorial service for the victims of the Tucson attack to talk about the need for a new tone, which of course solidified the idea that the old tone was somehow at fault. In fact, none of the rhetoric (or the map) progressives had obsessed over was relevant in the case. The shooter was mentally ill, he was fixated on Giffords and he had never seen Palin’s map. But we still had the national conversation and conservatives were still asked to repudiate their rhetoric as if it were connected to a crime.

And speaking of crime, every time there is a significant incident of gun violence in the United States, the NRA is asked for comment. After the Newtown shooting (another incident involving a lone, unstable person) journalists were keeping track of the number of days since the NRA’s latest tweet. Should responsible gun owners be cast under a dark cloud every time someone with mental problems commits a horrible crime? Many gun owners would say no and a majority of Americans seem to agree with them. But that hasn’t stopped the media, especially the progressive media, from running with the narrative every chance they get.

Hectoring people with questions about acts of violence they are notconnected with has been part of the left’s playbook for years. What Fisher is angry about is exactly what many of his fellows in the progressive media do to conservatives at every opportunity. Actually it is different in one crucial way. As Fisher admits in his piece, asking Muslims for comment after a violent crime is, “explicitly and earnestly designed to combat Islamophobia and promote equal treatment of Muslims.” Conservatives being hectored by the media after a violent incident aren’t on the receiving end of any similar good intentions.

Left-wing publication Salon.com has republished former Labor Secretary and U.C. Berkeley professor Robert Reich’s conspiracy theory that last week’s anti-MILO riots at Berkeley, conducted by violent left-wing anarchists, were secretly planned by Breitbart News.

The post, which originally appeared on Robert Reich’s blog, has now been republished at Salon.

The claims are just as unsubstantiated as when Reich originally made them, on Don Lemon’s CNN show. (Lemon did not challenge his claims). The conspiracy theory has since been the subject of a scathing rebuke by the Washington Post.

Thursday night, Yiannopoulos had a friendly interview on Fox News’ “Tucker Carlson Tonight” — a show that, according to The Washington Post, has ridden anger at left-wing activism into best-in-class primetime ratings. Yiannopoulos wasn’t asked about the content of the speech that was shut down. The conversation focused instead on how Berkeley proved the point that the left was ceding its right to federal grants by cracking down on free speech. That raises the possibility that Yiannopoulos and Breitbart were in cahoots with the agitators, perhaps in order to lay the groundwork for a Trump crackdown on universities and their federal funding.

Speaking at a short photo op before the two met behind closed doors, May was mostly silent on Iran, but affirmed to Netanyahu her country’s commitment to a two-state solution with the Palestinians. Netanyahu had flown to the UK with the intention of pushing for a united US-UK-Israeli front against Tehran following new ballistic missile tests by Iran, and said all “responsible nations” should back new sanctions, essentially rolling back the nuclear agreement.

*AUTHORS: ['Neil Munro']
*ARTICLE: SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

The Seattle judge who temporarily banned the White House’s refugee reform plan acted after mistakenly claiming the federal government has not arrested jihadi migrants from the seven Muslim countries covered by the reform.

But the federal government has arrested and jailed at least 76 people since 2001 from the seven countries covered in the first stage of the president’s reform, which was announced late January.

SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

That fact means there is a huge error in the judge’s rationale for imposing a “Temporary Restraining Order” ban on the president’s popular reform of the expensive refugee and immigration programs.

In a hearing before the decision, Judge James Robart told a lawyer from the Department of Justice that the federal government has not arrested people since 2001 from any of the seven countries named in the reform, since the 20o1 atrocity in New York. “How many arrests have there been of foreign nationals for those seven countries since 9/11?” he asked.

The justice department’s lawyer replied, “Your Honor, I don’t have that information,” prompting Robart to answer his own question:

Let me tell, you, the answer to that is none, as best I can tell. You’re here arguing on behalf of someone that says we have to protect the United States from these individuals coming from these countries and there’s no support for that.

But according to a database built by the Senate’s immigration subcommittee, the federal government has arrested and convicted at least 73 people from the seven countries of Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Syria, Sudan, and Yemen.

The Senate’s database was assembled despite repeated refusals by Obama’s deputies to provide immigration-related data to the Senate subcommittee in 2016.

However, by reviewing public data, “at least 380 of the 580 individuals convicted of terrorism or terrorism-related offenses between September 11, 2001 and December 31, 2014, were born abroad,” the report concluded in June 2016. The committee’s report also added:

At least 380 of the 580 were foreign-born (71 were confirmed natural-born, and the remaining 129 are not known). Of the 380 foreign-born, at least 24 were initially admitted to the United States as refugees, and at least 33 had overstayed their visas. Additionally, of those born abroad, at least 62 were from Pakistan, 28 were from Lebanon, 22 were Palestinian, 21 were from Somalia, 20 were from Yemen, 19 were from Iraq, 16 were from Jordan, 17 were from Egypt, and 10 were from Afghanistan.

A check by Breitbart News shows that the people convicted include five Iranians, 19 Iraqis, two Libyans, 21 Somalians, six Syrians, three Sudanese and 20 Yemenis. That’s a total of 76 people, at least.

The committee’s review of arrestees was overseen by Alabama Republican Sen. Jeff Sessions, then-chairman of the Senate immigration panel.

Sessions is expected to become the nation’s Attorney General, and will likely reverse the justice department’s 2016 policy of hiding information about terrorists’ immigration status from the public.

A review of the Senate’s data in 2016 by Breitbart News showed that at least 100 men named for Mohammed have been arrested and convicted for jihad-related crimes since 2001.

Since President Donald Trump took office on January 20, a trend has been emerging in which news media outlets have featured articles quoting health care professionals questioning the billionaire’s mental stability in a seeming bid to delegitimize the president.

And now some Democratic politicians – and at least one Republican – are calling for Trump to be subjected to a psychiatric examination to determine whether he is fit for office. Some commentators have even suggested invoking the 25th Amendment of the Constitution, which allows for the commander-in-chief’s removal from office if the “president is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office.”

This comes after the left’s multiple failed attempts to overthrow Trump’s presidency, including the recount efforts supported by Hillary Clinton; a doomed campaign to get Trump’s electors to defect before the Electoral College voted in December; and claims that Russian “hacking” impacted the 2016 election.

The health care professionals quoted in recent weeks attempting to diagnose Trump seem to be violating the so-called Goldwater Rule, which was established by the American Psychiatric Association after similar unsupported attacks against Senator Barry Goldwater during his 1964 presidential campaign, which was widely considered a threat to the political establishment.

The APA’s Goldwater Rule forbids psychiatrists from commenting on someone’s mental status unless they first carry out an examination and the doctor is authorized by the patient to speak to the public.

On Thursday, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said she would back a proposal suggested by Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) during a meeting with the Washington Post’s editorial board to consider legislation requiring all presidents to get medical and mental health examinations. Chaffetz clarified that he wasn’t referring to Trump’s rhetoric.

Post columnist Ruth Marcus related:

In a meeting last week with The Washington Post editorial board, Utah Republican Jason Chaffetz, chair of the House Oversight Committee, said he was weighing legislation to require presidents to undergo an independent medical examination, including mental health. Chaffetz cautioned that he wasn’t “talking about some of the rhetoric that’s flying around” about Trump. Still, he said, “If you’re going to have your hands on the nuclear codes, you should probably know what kind of mental state you’re in.”

Right on cue, Rep. Ted Lieu (D-Calif.) tweeted last week about whether Trump should get a mental health exam.

Last 24 hrs on Twitter, @realDonaldTrump went on rant about "death & destruction," "FAKE NEWS," & "evil." Should he get mental health exam? — Ted Lieu (@tedlieu) February 4, 2017

A group calling itself “Citizen Therapists Against Trumpism” has been created, with a manifesto that includes a litany of wild claims.

Last week, U.S. News and World Report ran a story titled, “Temperament Tantrum: Some say President Donald Trump’s personality isn’t just flawed, it’s dangerous.”

The article quotes John D. Gartner, described as a “practicing psychotherapist who taught psychiatric residents at Johns Hopkins University Medical School,” claiming Trump is “dangerously mentally ill and temperamentally incapable of being president.”

Gartner’s quotes have since been picked up by numerous news media outlets in order to question Trump’s emotional health.

The Independent newspaper featured a story that also questioned Trump mental stability, titled, “’Malignant narcisissm’: Donald Trump displays classic traits of mental illness, claim psychologists.” The piece cited mental health professionals commenting on Trump’s alleged narcissism.

The article partially drew from a New York Daily News story published last week titled, “President Trump exhibits classic signs of mental illness, including ‘malignant narcissism,’ shrinks say.”

“Narcissism impairs his ability to see reality,” Dr. Julie Futrell, a clinical psychologist, told the newspaper while pointing out that she never actually treated Trump.

New York Times columnist Paul Krugman, who has no medical degree, weighed in on Trump’s health status, tweeting that the president is “obviously mentally ill.”

An American first: a president who was obviously mentally ill the moment he took office. Thanks, Comey https://t.co/FuZbCy5DxQ — Paul Krugman (@paulkrugman) January 24, 2017

The campaign to question Trump’s mental health may have an ultimate goal in mind.

Last Month, Will Rahn, political correspondent and managing director of politics for CBS News Digital wrote a commentary piece at CBSNews.com titled, “An obscure way to oust an American president.”

He pointed to the 25th Amendment as a way to declare a president unfit for command:

Regardless of whether Trump is suffering from some kind of mental ailment, the Constitution does provide a manual for what to do in case of presidential incapacity in the form of the 25th Amendment. In particular, a provision within Article 4 of the amendment lays out how a president can be forced to surrender his powers should he be ruled unable to fulfill his duties.

Rahn conceded the procedure, which would require action from the vice president, is highly unlikely:

There’s a lesson there for Mike Pence, should he ever take a look at Article 4 and start thinking it might be wise to ascend to the presidency a little early: failing in that effort would end his career, not to mention the careers of the secretaries who sign up to help him. That alone is a powerful incentive to avoid using the law.

So while it’s plausible that this president could be removed from office for reasons of mental illness, it’s still exceptionally unlikely he would. And, in any event, Mr. Trump would have to get a whole lot weirder than he’s been already before anyone could start seriously thinking about Article 4.

Last week, Breitbart News reported Rosa Brooks, a former Obama administration official, outlined four ways to “get rid” of Trump, including declaring him mentally unfit for command or carrying out a military coup.

*TITLE: Muslim Brotherhood Protests Removal of Jihad Verses From Jordanian Curriculum

JAFFA, Israel – Dozens of Quranic verses have been removed from the Jordanian national curriculum, including those referencing jihad, prompting criticism from the Muslim Brotherhood and its representatives in Jordan.

Huda Alatoum, an educator and high-profile MP for the Muslim Brotherhood, said that “far-reaching changes” have been introduced in Jordan’s school program that remove verses and hadiths (oral traditions) “pertaining to Prophet Mohammed’s life.”

SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

“About 40 percent of the curriculum about Arabic language and Islam have been changed, including the removal of all reference to jihad and opposing the occupation of Palestine,” she charged, adding that “325 verses and 75 Islamic texts have been removed.”

She concluded by warning that “even worse changes” are ahead.

Alatoum said she decided to hold a press conference after her protest efforts in parliament met with failure. In her addresses to the plenary, she repeatedly claimed that the amendments were decided without the approval of parliament’s Education Committee.

Al-Monitor reported on the curriculum changes:

A religious and political dispute continues to brew in Jordan over a controversial move by the Ministry of Education to revamp the curricula of the three elementary grades. According to Deputy Prime Minister Jawad Anani, the changes are part of the government’s strategy to combat extremism in society.

Changes to school textbooks introduced this year involve coverage of Islam, history, Arabic and civics. For example, in civics, reference is made to acknowledge Christians as a demographic component of the population with pictures of churches as well as mosques. In religion, entire verses from the Quran and sayings by the Prophet Muhammad have been removed, while in Arabic literature, a picture of a veiled woman was replaced with one showing an unveiled woman. In Arabic-language textbooks for the third grade, a Quranic verse was replaced by a text on swimming. No changes were made to books on the sciences, mathematics and art.

The issue of extremism in the school curricula and the reforms proposed are dividing the country. Conservatives, including the Muslim Brotherhood’s Islamic Action Front (IAF), which contested the Sept. 20 Lower House elections, have denounced the move “as an affront to our heritage and values aimed at distancing future generations from its religion, its Arab identity, its history and traditions.”

Alatoum’s campaign became a sensation on social media.

“That’s what the West wants, a generation that knows nothing about its religion except prayer and fasting,” Misbah tweeted. “They amend the curriculum pretending to root out extremism, but they introduce only corruption instead.”

“Allah bless Huda Alatoum,” Ibrahim Altamimi tweeted after a speech she gave in December.

Mohammed Bilal called the new curriculum “American Islam,” saying, “Dr. Huda Alatoum, MP, talks about effectively teaching American Islam in her country. Allah forbid.”

Another user protested “the Jordanian liberals’ attempt to change the curriculum.”

Jordan’s King Abdullah II visited the United States last week and met several officials from the new administration, including President Donald Trump.

The king’s visit came against a background of growing concerns that terrorist organizations, especially the Islamic State, will seek to settle along Jordan’s borders with Iraq and Syria following their retreats from Raqqa and Mosul.

Unelected peers in the House of Lords could delay the United Kingdom’s departure from the European Union (EU) for up to a year by rejecting the bill which authorises the government to activate Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, the legal mechanism for beginning the Brexit process.

The Daily Mirror claims that all 104 Liberal Democrat peers plan to vote against the Article 50 bill currently navigating its way through the House of Commons, and that only 30 rebel Conservatives will have to join them for it to be sent back to MPs for reconsideration.

SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

While the House of Lords is described as the ‘Upper House’ and has the power to introduce as well as amend legislation, it is in practice junior to the elected House of Commons, serving primarily as a revising chamber.

When members of the House of Commons are determined to have a piece of legislation the House of Lords will not agree to, it can be forced past them under the Parliament Acts of 1911 and 1949 – but this can take up to a year, which would sabotage the government’s Brexit timetable.

Tory peers who might be expected to join the Liberal Democrats in opposing the Article 50 bill include Baroness (Patience) Wheatcroft, who insists that “the referendum was only advisory” and that, “faced with potential calamity”, it is her colleagues’ job “to ask the government to think again”.

“The Commons may be cowed by the narrow majority of the referendum”, she wrote in August 2016, “but, on this vital matter, I believe the Lords should urge caution”.

Lord Newby, who leads the Liberal Democrats in the Lords, has called on Tories like Baroness Wheatcroft to join him in challenging Theresa May’s decision to take Britain out of the so-called Single Market, which underpins the unlimited and largely unvetted Free Movement immigration system which operates throughout the EU.

The Article 50 bill already faces of 146 pages of “wrecking amendments” tabled by Labour, Liberal Democrat, and Scottish Nationalist MPs in the House of Commons. It is reported that up to twenty-seven Tories, led by veteran europhile Ken Clarke, may support them.

Theresa May has a Commons majority of just sixteen.

HOUSTON, Texas – In addition to massive security constraints, Super Bowl attendees will also have to face possible disruption of their arrival plans by Black Lives Matter protesters.

Black Lives Matter organizers are planning a protest dubbed “Stand Up, Fight Back: Super Bowl LI Protest March.”

SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

“It is time for the city government of Houston to see how diverse we are,” organizers posted on Facebook. “The grand claim was made that we are a ‘welcoming city,’ but the treatment of the local homeless community, gentrification, lack clarity on where our elected leaders stand on Trump’s policies and of course the issue of anti Blackness need to be addressed.”

“WE WILL MARCH UP FANNIN FROM HERMANN PARK TO NRG PARK. RAIN OR SHINE,” organizers wrote.

The march is scheduled to coincide with the arrival of attendees to the Super Bowl. Attendees have been encouraged to use public transportation. Some of the seating capacity of these buses and trains could be taken up by protesters in an attempt to slow down the attendees’ arrival to the NRG Stadium. The protest is expected to end before game time.

A massive security operation is underway in advance of Sunday’s Super Bowl LI presentation. Additional resources have been brought in from local, state, and federal law enforcement agencies.

U.S. Customs and Border Protection is adding resources to the effort to maintain safety at the event. The agency tasked with securing our nation’s borders and ports of entry is providing aviation and electronic resources in addition to manpower. “LOOK @CustomsBorder working with many partners @HoustonTX to ensure safe #SB51 #SEESOMETHINGSAYSOMETHING,” the agency tweeted on Saturday.

Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner told Breitbart Texas in a conversation on Thursday he is pulling out all the stops to make sure the Super Bowl goes off without the kind of incidents of violence seen in other parts of the country.

“It is what it is. People know how I feel about it. Just follow me on Twitter,” New England Patriots tight end Martellus Bennett said when he announced he would not attend the White House celebration with President Trump for the victors of Super Bowl LI on Sunday.

Bennett stated that he’s “not really worried” about the fact that Tom Brady, Coach Belichick, and Patriots owner Robert Kraft have all expressed their friendship with the nation’s 45th president. “I’m not worried about it at all,” he insisted.

One day before the November presidential election, Bennett tweeted “I’m with her,” indicating that he planned on casting his vote for Hillary Clinton.

Bennett also tweeted in January that the “president dude” was not inclusive and worried that Trump may ban celebrating the Chinese New Year in America:

Surprised the president dude didn't ban celebrating Chinese New Year in America!! — Martellus Bennett (@MartysaurusRex) January 29, 2017

The 29-year-old second round draft choice by the Dallas Cowboys in 2008 insists that he doesn’t bring his political views to work. “We all have our beliefs. We accept people for who they are,” asserts Bennett.

Apparently, Bennett who connected with Brady for five passes and drew a crucial pass interference call toward the end of overtime doesn’t plan on accepting President Trump “for who he is,” as Yahoo Sports pointed out.

Bennett is not the first to boycott a Super Bowl gathering with the sitting president. In 2015, after the Pats won Super Bowl 49 by beating the Seahawks, Tom Brady did not make it to the White House gala hosted by former president Barack Obama.

Boston Red Sox outfielder Manny Ramirez famously didn’t make it to the World Series victory gathering to meet George W. Bush claiming he “just didn’t feel like it.” Bush 43 quipped, “I’m sorry [David Ortiz’s] running mate, Manny Ramirez, isn’t here, I guess his grandmother died again. Just kidding. Tell Manny I didn’t mean it.”

“Aaron Klein Investigative Radio,” the popular Sunday night talk radio show, has once again been ranked among the annual list of 50 most-listened-to talk radio shows streamed on the Internet.

The program is hosted by Breitbart’s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter Aaron Klein.

Klein made the “Power 50” list of Talk Stream Live, which was released on Monday and drew from a sample of 11.6 million Internet listener sessions during 2016 to compile the listing of “The 50 Most Influential and Most Listened-To Streaming Talk Show Hosts.”

Breitbart News Daily, broadcast daily on SiriusXM Patriot Channel 125 from 6AM to 9AM Eastern and hosted by Breitbart Editor-in-Chief Alex Marlow, was not ranked by Talk Stream Live since the satellite radio show does not stream live on the Internet.

Radio giant Michael Savage came in at number one on the “Power 50” list, evidencing Savage’s enormous following among Internet listeners in addition to his top terrestrial radio ratings.

Klein’s program, broadcast on terrestrial radio on New York’s AM 970 The Answer and NewsTalk 990 AM in Philadelphia, came in at No. 40 on the Internet “power” rankings. The rating is particularly noteworthy since Klein’s weekend broadcast airs only once per week for two hours. His weekend program beat out major national shows that broadcast three hours a day, five days a week.

In his last press conference of 2014, President Barack Obama blamed Sony for pulling The Interview after hacking attacks and terror threats from North Korea. Yet not only did President Obama do and say nothing to defend Sony at the time, he also created a precedent in Benghazi in 2012 that likely contributed to Sony’s surrender. By blaming an obscure YouTube video, and jailing the filmmaker, Obama sent a signal that he would not protect American filmmakers from foreign attacks.

In that light, Obama’s remarks are clearly a cowardly attempt to shift blame entirely to the filmmaker. While Sony probably deserves much of the criticism it is receiving for its swift surrender, no private company can be expected to stand up, alone, to cyber-terrorist threats from a nuclear-armed dictatorship.

The sports media managed to find themselves a Republican from the sports world that they actually like.

What kind of Republican would it take to secure the approval of our reliably leftist sports media? Well, a Muslim Republican who trashes President Trump’s immigration executive order, while making historically inaccurate references to our founding documents.

SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Enter Jaguars owner Shahid Khan, described by the Sporting News as, “a Republican and Muslim who opposes Donald Trump’s travel freeze.”

According to the New York Times, Khan said, “The bedrock of this country are immigration and really a great separation between church and state. Even for the country, it’s not good.”

Khan continued, viewing Trump’s executive order as, “kind of a sobering time for somebody like me.” He added that the order would prevent the influx of, “tens of thousands of people who can contribute to the making of America.”

While few dispute the importance and relevance of immigrants to America’s history, the notion that our country will cease to exist over the next four months without Middle Eastern refugees, is highly suspect. Nor, would this country have ever become the massive haven for immigrants throughout history had we made a habit of letting in people from terrorist-infested countries, without a workable vetting system.

As for separation of church and state, clearly Mr. Khan must have studied bedrock American principles at the Chuck Schumer School of Advanced Leftist Demagoguery. The words “separation of church and state” appear nowhere in the U.S. Constitution, Declaration of Independence, or Bill of Rights, which are the places where our founders put all the “bedrock principles.”

It appears only in a letter that Thomas Jefferson sent to the Danbury Baptists in 1802. It did not appear in the mainstream vernacular of American jurisprudence until the Supreme Court case Everson vs. Board of Education in 1947, where a racist and one-time Klansman justice named Hugo Black, who did not believe in the supernatural aspects of Christianity, inserted the quote in order to hurt religion in future cases.

And, thanks to the American left’s shameless quoting of a Klansman, a man they would otherwise claim to disagree with, Justice Black succeeded in doing just that.

70 years after Everson, the left is just as willing to quote someone saying something historically inaccurate to advance their agenda.

My, how things haven’t changed.

*TITLE: US tight-lipped as Israel settler law sparks world outrage

*AUTHORS: []
*ARTICLE: SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Jerusalem (AFP) – The United States was conspicuously tight-lipped Tuesday amid a world outcry over a new Israeli law allowing the appropriation of private Palestinian land for Jewish settler outposts.

SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

The United Nations, the European Union and the Arab League were just some of those coming out against the legislation passed in parliament late Monday.

“This bill is in contravention of international law and will have far reaching legal consequences for Israel,” UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said in a statement.

“The European Union condemns the recent adoption of the ‘Regularisation Law’,” foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini said, arguing it “crosses a new and dangerous threshold by legalising under Israeli law the seizure of Palestinian property rights”.

The law legalises dozens of wildcat outposts and thousands of settler homes in the occupied West Bank, and prompted a Palestinian call for the international community to punish Israel.

Pro-Palestinian Israeli NGOs said they would ask the Supreme Court to strike down the law, and opposition leader Isaac Herzog warned the legislation could result in Israeli officials facing the International Criminal Court.

Washington refused direct comment, in stark contrast to the settlement criticism repeatedly voiced under Barack Obama.

“Prime Minister (Benjamin) Netanyahu will be here on February 15. I don’t want to get ahead of that now,” White House spokesman Sean Spicer said.

The US State Department said President Donald Trump’s new administration “needs to have the chance to fully consult with all parties on the way forward”.

– ‘Stealing Palestinian land’ –

France called the bill a “new attack on the two-state solution”, while Britain said it “damages Israel’s standing with its international partners”.

Turkey “strongly condemned” the law and Israel’s “unacceptable” settlement policy, and the Arab League accused Israel of “stealing the land and appropriating the property of Palestinians”.

Britain and Israel’s Arab neighbour Jordan also expressed concern.

Separately to the new law, Israel has approved more than 6,000 settler homes since Trump took office on January 20 having signalled a softer stance on the issue than his predecessor.

The law, which passed 60 to 52 in its final reading, will allow Israel to legally seize Palestinian private land on which Israelis built outposts without knowing it was private property or because the state allowed them to do so.

Palestinian owners will be compensated financially or with other land.

It would apply to around 53 outposts as well as some houses within existing settlements, potentially legalising more than 3,800 homes, according to anti-settlement NGO Peace Now, which called the law “another step towards annexation and away from a two-state solution”.

The law could still be challenged, with Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman saying last week it was likely to be struck down by the Supreme Court.

International law considers all settlements illegal, but Israel distinguishes between those it sanctions and those it does not, which are known as outposts.

– Protection for settlers –

The new law would protect settlers against eviction from outposts discovered to have been built on private Palestinian lands such as in the case of Amona, where 42 families were evicted and their homes demolished in recent days by order of Israel’s Supreme Court.

To some Israelis, the law reflects their God-given right over the territory, regardless of the courts, the Palestinians and the international community.

“All of the Land of Israel belongs to the Jewish people,” said Science Minister Ofir Akunis of Netanyahu’s Likud party, using the biblical term that includes the West Bank.

“This right is eternal and indisputable.”

Palestinian official Hanan Ashrawi called for the international community to assume its “moral, human and legal responsibilities and put an end to Israel’s lawlessness”.

The act marked the first time Israel applied its civil law to land in the West Bank recognised as Palestinian, law professor Amichai Cohen told AFP.

UN Middle East peace envoy Nickolay Mladenov also raised the possibility of potential court cases in the International Criminal Court against Israeli officials.

Israeli Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit has also warned the government that the law may be unconstitutional and risks exposing Israel to international prosecution for war crimes.

Human Rights Watch said the legislation “reflects Israel’s manifest disregard of international law”.

“The Trump administration cannot shield them from the scrutiny of the International Criminal Court,” HRW warned.

Bezalel Smotrich of the far-right Jewish Home party, one of the forces behind the legislation, thanked the American people for electing Trump as president, “without whom the law would have probably not passed”.

Two Republican senators took up the baton for populist immigration reform Tuesday when they announced their Reforming American Immigration for Strong Employment, or RAISE Act, designed to raise wages for ordinary Americans, restore legacy immigration levels, and reset family and worker visa programs.

“We are taking action to fix some of the shortcomings in our legal immigration system—returning to our historically normal levels of legal immigration will help improve the quality of American jobs and wages,” said Georgia’s Sen. David A. Perdue Jr., who served on the chamber’s Judiciary Committee and was one the first and foremost Senate supporters of President Donald J. Trump’s campaign. Purdue was joined by Arkansas Sen. Thomas B. Cotton, his co-sponsor.

“This is a first step,” Perdue said. “It is not a sweeping, comprehensive attempt to solve all legal immigration problems, nor does it address illegal issues. We are simply trying today to bring a rational, compassionate approach to this issue inside the immigration conversation.”

The bill is not a rejection of immigration, which is an important part of the country’s heritage, he said. “But, we see the records and we see the data and we see wages being absolutely depressed because of the supply of low-skilled workers.”

A Capitol Hill source close to Perdue told Breitbart News that the senator is motivated by the president’s attention to the immigration crisis, especially when it comes to eliminating the so-called “diversity lottery” visa program and other outdated programs.

Cotton said he spoke to the president about the general outlines of the bill during the campaign and that morning.

While he would not say that Trump endorsed the bill, he was clear that it is in line with the president’s priorities, and he and Perdue have an ongoing partnership with the White House staff.

The Army Ranger veteran of Afghanistan and Iraq said his bill with Perdue takes the number of legal immigrants from million to 500,000 per year without addressing the employment-based immigration programs.

Cotton said this bill makes it a simple matter of supply and demand.

“There has been a generation’s-long decline in blue collar wages,” he said. “The natural effect of having low-skills and no-skills workers in this country is going to be a tighter labor market that is going to put more upward pressure on wages of working folks.”

The RAISE Act shuts chain-migration, so siblings, parents, and other members of a legal immigrant’s extended family are no longer automatically waved into the country, he said. However, the bill does allow for temporary visas for elderly parents, who are not coming to America to work or go on public assistance.

Cotton had to repeatedly tell reporters that the bill is designed to primarily help American. “Our immigration system should focus on what is good for American citizens–and if parents and siblings or adult children or their spouses have the skills that they need to succeed in our economy and contribute, then they can come in through other employment-based programs.”

Cotton said the bill is focused on the 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act that remains the country’s framework. “We are looking for a more rational system.”

The Arkansas senator said that the immigration laws between 1924 and 1965 were too restrictive and there was a need in 1965 to open things up, especially given the record of America’s handling a refugees in the 1920s and 1930s.

“Overall, you will see a reduction in the number of immigrants, but you may see an increase in other categories, where there is an empirical and demonstrated need for more immigrant labor–particularly among the skilled and the ultra-high skilled,” he said.

President Donald Trump lamented that an Obamacare repeal may take until 2018 in an interview with Bill O’Reilly on Super Bowl Sunday.

“I would like to say by the end of the year, at least the rudiments, but we should have something within the year and the following year,” the president explained.

Republican leaders originally set the Obamacare repeal deadline on January 27th. That deadline was quickly brushed away given increasing disunity regarding Obamacare’s repeal. Secret recordings of the Republican retreat in Philadelphia revealed a deluge of uncertainty from Republican leaders, the rank-and-file. Arguments included whether to repeal and replace Obamacare simultaneously or separately, to maintain Obamacare’s taxes to fund a replacement, and to keep the states Obamacare exchanges.

Since then, Republicans leaders such as House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Greg Walden (R.-Ore.) believe that the scope of healthcare reform needs to change from “replace” to “repair.” Speaker Ryan rebuked that rhetoric by called Obamacare a “collapsing law.” He noted, “Somewhere along the line there was confusion that we were going to take the Obamacare architecture and, you know, tinker at the margins and repair it.”

Despite the rhetoric, it is unclear how Republicans plan to repeal Obamacare beyond reconciliation, where any Obamacare repeal will require the support of Democrats. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer promised no cooperation from Democrats unless there will be a repeal-and-replace package at the same time, and “So long as it covers as many people as the ACA, so long as it helps bring healthcare costs down, so long as it doesn’t move our healthcare system backward.”

The American Medical Association, the largest association of doctors, wrote a letter to Congress in January providing a roadmap for what “in reasonable detail what will replace current policies.” Vice President Mike Pence speaking with ABC’s George Stephanopoulos said that there will be a smooth transition between repeal and replace, noting, “He’s also made it very clear that at the same time that we repeal Obamacare, we’re going through both executive action and through legislation, set into motion a replacement of Obamacare that will be orderly and will lead the American people.”

Senator Lamar Alexander (R.-Tenn.), Chairman of the Senate Health Committee said argued that Obamacare’s repeal will only take place when there is a practical alternative, saying:

I think of Obamacare like a collapsing bridge. If your local bridge were “very near collapse,” the first thing you would do is send in a rescue crew to repair it temporarily so no one else is hurt. Then you would build a better bridge, or more accurately, many bridges, as states develop their own plans for providing access to truly affordable health care to replace the old bridge. Finally, as the new bridges are finished and safe to drive across, you would close the old bridge.

While Congress will vote to repeal and replace Obamacare this year, the repeal of Obamacare finally will become effective when our reforms are implemented and we have concrete, practical alternatives.

I believe this is what the President means when he says we will repeal and replace Obamacare simultaneously and what Speaker Ryan means when he says we will repeal and replace Obamacare concurrently.

Sen. Alexander is a proponent of repealing and replacing at the same time, an idea that President Donald Trump has signed onto in the past. Any form of repeal would only be effective after there is a practical alternative that includes several of the popular republican reforms to Obamacare, such as shopping insurance plans across state lines, and expansion of health savings accounts.

There are number of plans to replace Obamacare, including from Sens. Susan Collins (R-ME) and Bill Cassidy (R-LA), a separate plan from Senator Rand Paul (R-KY), as well as from Speaker Ryan. However, there is little consensus from Congress, or the White House on which plan will be implemented to replace Obamacare. There is also little agreement on when the plan will take place, Speaker Ryan has mentioned March or April, but with President Trump’s remarks it seems that Obamacare may stay until even 2018.

President Trump said that Obamacare repeal is “very complicated” but reminds everyone that “Obamacare is a disaster.”

Warner Bros. released the first trailer for its big-screen remake of 70s television series CHiPs on Thursday.

The updated take on the old show finds Michael Peña and Dax Shepard taking on the roles of California Highway Patrol officers Frank “Ponch” Poncharello and Jon Baker, played in the original series by Erik Estrada and Larry Wilcox.

SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Here’s the studio’s official synopsis for the new movie:

Jon Baker (Shepard) and Frank “Ponch” Poncherello (Peña) have just joined the California Highway Patrol (CHP) in Los Angeles but for very different reasons. Baker is a beaten up pro motorbiker trying to put his life and marriage back together. Poncherello is a cocky undercover Federal agent investigating a multi-million dollar heist that may be an inside job—inside the CHP. The inexperienced rookie and hardened pro are teamed together, but clash more than click, so kickstarting a partnership is easier said than done. But with Baker’s bike skills combined with Ponch’s street savvy it might just work…if they don’t drive each other crazy along the way.

The original series debuted in 1977 and ran for six seasons on NBC.

The film adaptation was written and directed by Shepard and also stars Kristen Bell, Adam Brody, Ryan Hansen, Maya Rudolph and Vincent D’Onofrio.

CHiPs is in theaters March 24.

A poll conducted after former European Union (EU) President Martin Schulz assumed leadership of the German Social Democrats (SPD) sees the party now ahead of Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Christian Democrats (CDU).

The poll conducted by INSA on behalf of German magazine Bild shows the SPD with 31 per cent of the votes and the CDU with 30 per cent. The poll marks the first time since August 2010 that the SPD has polled better than the conservative CDU, Die Welt reports.

SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

The anti-mass migration Alternative for Germany (AfD) managed to hold onto their position as the third most supported party in the country with 12 per cent of the votes. They are followed by the far-left Die Linke, the Green party, and the libertarian-leaning Free Democratic party who polled at six per cent, just above the five per cent threshold to score seats in the parliament.

Hermann Binkert, head of INSA, said that the results reflected the effect of former EU president Martin Schulz taking over the party leadership from Sigmar Gabriel. “The Bundestag election is completely open,” he said.

The spokesman for the inner circle of the SPD, known as the Seeheimer Kreis, Johannes Kahrs was emboldened by the poll and told German media, “Merkel is like Kohl in 1998. People want a new face.” Helmut Kohl was chancellor of Germany from 1982 to 1998 and was a former leader of the CDU.

Given the result of the poll, a new coalition could be formed yet again by the two major parties, though there could also be an option for the SPD to join with the Greens and the far-left Die Linke as they have recently done in Berlin if the parties can manage to score a few extra percentage points. The red-red-green coalition in the German capital has already gone against the federal government on the subject of deportations.

Martin Schulz has already laid out his plan for defeating Angela Merkel in the September election saying that by working so much with Merkel he had gotten to know her and knows how to defeat her.

Should Mr. Schulz become the new German Chancellor later this year, the rhetoric against the Trump administration could heighten given his past comments on the U.S. president. Last week, Schulz called President Donald J. Trump’s recent policies “unAmerican” and said, “If Trump is now driving a wrecking ball through this set of values, then I will tell him as chancellor: that’s not the policy of Germany and Europe.”

1. Target: Trump

Is there a media-driven “climate of violence”? You bet there is, and it’s being whipped up by the left and the Main Stream Media, here and around the world. And it has a clear purpose: The ultimate goal is the destruction of the Trump presidency—and, for at least some, seemingly, the goal is the assassination of President Trump himself.

SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

But don’t take Virgil’s word for it: Have a look at the cover of Village magazine. That cover shows a rifle’s crosshairs superimposed on a photograph of Trump’s head. And the headline reads, “Why not.”

The once-obscure magazine, published in Ireland, is now basking in worldwide attention, and American social media are happy to magnify Village’s glorification of a criminal act. Here’s that deadly image, for example, on Twitter. As an aside, we might ask: Doesn’t Twitter have rules against “hate speech” and “incitement of violence”? Or are they not enforced when the target is on the right?

The Village article itself plays a clever editorial game. It begins by describing Trump as “a purveyor of hatred” and then lists all his other purported sins, including the mistreatment of refugees, an overall wrong-headed foreign policy, retrograde ideas on “climate change,” and opposition to abortion.

After that litany, the magazine considers the options: “So perhaps the solution is tyrannicide. As he might say himself—‘take him out.’”

Next, under the heading, “Kill Him?” the magazine proceeds to cite philosophers and theologians who have declared tyrannicide to be justifiable, from Cicero to Thomas Aquinas to Martin Luther. And then, to rub the point in even harder, the magazine admiringly recalls the German Klaus von Stauffenberg, who nearly succeeded in killing Hitler in 1944. The message is obvious: Trump is another Hitler, and so you, the reader, must decide for yourself what to do next.

Yet then, having raised all these issues in the most load-the-deck manner possible, the magazine pulls back, sort of, at the last moment. It writes, “Shooting Trump is unnecessary and disproportionate.”

Of course, we all know what’s going on here. Indeed, Virgil recognizes the technique employed by Village as a variant on the ancient rhetorical device known as paralepsis–that is, raising an idea while pretending not to raise it. Having argued, vehemently and at length, that Trump is a civilization-level menace, the magazine then adds a few weasel-words about not harming him. So Village hopes that it has itself covered: If any bad fate befalls Trump, its writers will say, as they barely conceal their smirks, “Gee, we didn’t want that to happen!”

Indeed, even before the Village article, the idea of killing the 45th president was out there—bigtime. Various celebrities and rappers have wished death, if not murder, on Trump.

And Twitter seems to be a favored venue: The online publication Mashable reports in just the first 12 days of the Trump presidency, more than 12,000 tweets have called for the President’s assassination. As the story notes, this volume of threats is far beyond the capacity of the US Secret Service to investigate.

Meanwhile, the incendiary attacks keep coming. Under the header, “Beau Willimon Declares War On Donald Trump,” Deadline: Hollywood details the strenuous efforts of the House of Cards creator to bring the President down. The article details Willimon’s voluminous tweets, including his own mock-version of the Declaration of Independence, which begins with the words:

When in the course of American history it becomes necessary for the people to save our Nation from a Tyrant,

We can pause over that word, “tyrant.” At the end of his 25-tweet rant, Willimon writes that his preferred method for getting rid of Trump is impeachment. However, a casual reader might not read all the way to the end. Or a reader with his or her own imagination might be provoked into think that stronger measures are needed; that is, by any means necessary. And Trump is, after all, a “tyrant,” right? Some undoubtedly will think of the Latin words spoken by John Wilkes Booth moments after he shot President Lincoln in 1865: Sic semper tyrannis! (Thus always to tyrants!)

Of course, Twitter, could delete all these inflammatory tweets with the flick of an algorithm, and yet it doesn’t seem interested in doing anything at all. One might even speculate that Twitter management agrees with them.

Meanwhile, as we all remember, Twitter has always been in a quick hurry to enforce left-wing PC orthodoxy on right-wingers; it has permanently suspended the Twitter account of Milo Yiannopoulos, as well as others, for supposed non-criminal incitement. And yet now, confronted with literal criminal incitement, Twitter does nothing. It doesn’t take a student of classical rhetoric to recognize hypocrisy.

Perhaps one day, Twitter, and other social media, will get around to deleting these offensive, dangerous, and illegal posts. Of course, perhaps one day, it will be too late. Perhaps then, in the view of the anti-Trump haters, it will be a case of the end justifying the means—“mission: accomplished.”

2. The “Climate of Violence”—The Left Loves It So Much

So let’s look more closely at this idea of a “climate of violence,” which is said to foster acts of actual violence. Sometimes this inflammatory “climate” is real, and sometimes it is not real. We’ve learned that while the political left usually says that it opposes this sort of violence-inducing “climatology,” in fact, quite often, it embraces it—even adores it.

Yes, today, the left talks a lot about “peace,” “coexistence,” and all that. And yet, as Virgil wrote in January, when it comes to Trump, one tool of the left, the MSM, gets notably militant; it becomes hormonally eager to reach for violent imagery.

So it’s in this context that we must evaluate extreme anti-Trump media items, such as the semi-suggestion of Rosa Brooks, a former high official in the Obama administration, that what’s needed is a military coup d’etat against the Trump White House. We can note that Brooks published this piece in a well-known MSM outlet, Foreign Policy, on January 30, and it’s still there. Nobody in the MSM, at least, seems to have a problem with it.

More recently, in the same pro-violence spirit, the German magazine Der Spiegel, arguably the most influential publication in that country, unveiled a cover story showing a knife-wielding Trump holding high the bloodily decapitated head of Liberty, from the Statue of Liberty. The message to readers is clear: We must stop this madman before it’s too late.

We can note that the Spiegel cover was admiringly echoed all over the planet; among the admirers was The Washington Post, which, sticking up for the American media, pointed out that The New York Daily News had presented a similar cover back in December 2015.

Meanwhile, as John Nolte has chronicled, CNN has been a serial offender: For more than a year now, it has hurled, against Trump, just about every loaded epithet imaginable.

And it’s not just Trump. It’s also his staff that’s in the crosshairs. For instance, on February 5, USA Today published an editorial entitled, “What Bannon shares with ISIL leader.” Yes, you read that right: A newspaper that claims a readership in the many millions just equated White House adviser Stephen K. Bannon and the Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. As the piece asserted brazenly, the two “share similar world views.”

We might pause to note that this was an editorial, as opposed to a random opinion piece. In other words, the words represent the collective judgment of the USA Today editorial board, whose names can be found here. Yes, this is what they really think. The sheer nuttiness of the editorial aside, we can observe that the piece is seemingly an open invitation to take, uh, strong action against Bannon.

So, yes, the left hates the “climate of violence”—except when it loves it.

And there’s a long history: Perhaps the most cynical use of the “climate” trope has been the way that the left has twisted the cultural and historical memory of the assassination of President John F. Kennedy in 1963.

That tragic incident, of course, occurred in Dallas; then, and now, North Texas has been a conservative area. And so for more than half-a-century, it’s been an MSM cliche—boosted by prominent historians, such as Arthur Schlesinger, Jr.—that a local “climate of hate” was somehow responsible for JFK’s death. Even today, after it’s been established beyond doubt that the assassin, Lee Harvey Oswald, was a pro-Castro communist, the “climate of hate” meme still persists in the MSM. In other words, it’s the fault of Dallas, and the right, that Kennedy was murdered.

Similarly, after the 2011 shooting of Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, the left/MSM immediately heaped the blame on “right-wing media.” And this drumbeat has continued, even after it was learned that the shooter, Jared Lee Loughner, was sexually obsessed with Giffords and was listening to nothing but the voices in his head.

More recently still, in 2016, we were reminded that the left never objects to a climate of violence—if it’s for a “good cause.” Thanks to the efforts of James O’Keefe and others, it’s easy to find abundant, we-have-it-on-tape evidence that the Clinton campaign, or at least its close allies, deliberately sent provocateurs to Trump rallies to cause trouble—trouble which then could then be blamed on Trump. In the summarizing words of Breitbart’s Joel Pollak:

Clinton’s defenders might claim she did not know anything about the tactics being used, but that defense does not suffice. The consultants who carried out the tactic, centered around Robert Creamer and his Democracy Partners organization, told O’Keefe’s undercover investigators that they had set up a “double-blind” system so that Clinton would not have to know directly about any particular action being taken on her behalf, but Creamer appeared to admit on video that Clinton had general knowledge about their activities.

Needless to say, state and local authorities have been completely uninterested in pursuing any of these seemingly open-and-shut cases of conspiracy and incitement.

And the beat goes on. In DC on January 21, the pop-singer Madonna, speaking to a large crowd of angry feminist protesters, mused about “blowing up the White House.” And she has continued to defend her remarks, which could reasonably be construed as incitement to violence, even murder. (One can only imagine what would have happened if a conservative had said that.) And yet of course, Madonna will face no economic or legal consequences; indeed, Hollywood will probably find a way to give her some new award or endorsement gig.

In the meantime, out west, Milo Yiannopoulos has also been the object of a “climate of violence.” And yet for their part, pressies have oscillated between yawning and cheering. A man was shot and critically wounded in Seattle, and still, the MSM didn’t much care, because, after all, the man seems to have been a Milo supporter.

And just a few days ago, at the University of California’s Berkeley campus, rioters shut down a Milo appearance. As Milo said afterward, the rioting “tells you something very, very clear about the left’s commitment to free expression.” It’s worth recalling that back in 1964, Berkeley was the hub of what was grandiosely dubbed, by students, as the “Free Speech Movement.” Now, 53 years later, the self-proclaimed guardians of the First Amendment have had no interest in upholding Milo’s constitutional right to free speech.

In fact, some on the left have gone the complete opposite way: toward fact-free ideological conspiracy-mongering. One such is UC Berkeley’s Robert Reich, the former Clinton cabinet secretary; Reich went on TV to accuse the right—and specifically, Breitbart—of causing the violence, as a provocation against the left. In other words, the whole fracas was Milo’s fault. Talk about blaming the victim!

Reich’s brand of fantastic projection was too much for Rush Limbaugh, who asked of his radio-show audience:

Do you know any right-wingers capable of this kind of behavior? I mean, go to Ferguson, go to Baltimore, go to San Bernardino, go to Watts. Take any protest, any violence. Go to Oakland any time you want. Any time there is violent protests, it’s always left-wingers bought and paid for by the Hillary campaign, the Democrat Party, or George Soros, and never once have the Democrats ever condemned them, ’cause they’re proud of them.

Yes, that is correct: Cutting-edge Democrats have never condemned the violent hooligans doing their dirty work, for one simple reason—they’re proud of them.

And even now, Reich continues to unapologetically—make that, eagerly—spew his crackpot conspiratorializing. Obviously Reich is a devotee of the Big Lie: that is, a falsehood, repeated often enough, equals truth. So never mind the fact that we have since learned that it was the anti-Milo protesters who were on someone’s payroll—George Soros’ payroll. (We might also observe, not that any of the local authorities seem to have noticed, that the fomenting—and financing—of violence is a crime.)

As Milo told Fox News’ Tucker Carlson, the left’s game plan is to claim that its opponents are nothing but racists, sexists, white nationalists, anti-Semites, and homophobes. And to make these charges, the left doesn’t need any evidence, only the accusations. Once again, that’s the Big Lie technique. And yet such fact-free slandering is just fine with the MSM, which then goes to work amplifying the accusations, thus amping up, yes, the “culture of violence.” As Milo said:

The media has created this environment in which it’s okay to say almost anything about somebody who is right of Jane Fonda. … And it’s a way of legitimizing, in some cases, as happened last night, violent responses.

And we might add, beyond Milo, Breitbart itself is increasingly the target. Virgil might add that the tactics being used are straight out of Saul Alinsky’s Rules for Radicals. All of Alinsky’s “rules” are being practiced today, but we can focus on Rule #11: “Pick the target, freeze it, personalize it, and polarize it.”

Breitbart is tough; we’re used to fights and fighting. This wasn’t a fight we began, but it is a fight we seek to win. And yet everyone on the populist-nationalist right ought to see the current situation clearly: The hard left has plenty of resources, and no scruples about deploying those resources. And so Breitbart is just one of many targets. And of course, if the left can attack us, well, Soros & Co. won’t stop there. They’ll be coming for you next.

So that’s the real context of the vast “climate of violence” conjured up by the left. It’s all part of a master plan—a plan for mastery. That is, smash the enemy, and then rearrange the pieces into a new left-wing order.

Yet in the meantime, we must remember the main target: President Trump. And so we can can step back and observe, with grim certainty, the dream scenario of some on the other side:

A weird and bloody kind of lefty-media glory awaits the person who takes to heart the message of that cover story in Village.
