# TODO

## Final Submission
* Works cited from papers conglomerated at end per meeting feedback
* more detail about the items in work delegation (subtasks) per meeting feedback
* Title page with Team Name, team member names, and project title
* ### Clean up all first and second person pronouns in anything you wrote (remove all I, we, our, and so on). Yes this fucking sucks, but it would be dumb to lose points for it, everyone take care of it for what they wrote themselves, suck it up and get it done ;) 
* more to come from Gary's Doc III feedback..

### Meeting with Gary <3 <3 <3
- Include some examples underneath use cases to flesh them out
 - types of graph, reasons for them, radar chart if we can 
- fill out testing, add graphics for what tests
  - describe how we are going to pick clusters
  - describe how we will test classifications
  - describe methods, how we will verify they are accurate
  - ...
- more detail about the items in work delegation (subtasks)
- need define sprints if we use agile, good visualizations of development method choice
 - ex: sprint1, sprint2, ....
- pick development type
