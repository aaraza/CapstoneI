# CapstoneI
This our project for capstone. 

Group consisting of:

Kurt
Ali
Zach
Justin
Jared

We want to explore machine learning application development, language 
analysis, and predictions about news bias through integrating the preceeding technologies. 

This readme is a document detailing our brainstorming and thinking
 process throughout development. 

## TO DO

- [ ] backup database

- [ ] Label clusters by hand based on their contents

- [ ] Finish backend for classifying new article

- [ ] Finish frontend for submitting and classifying article

- [ ] Finish classification feature for site

- [ ] Finish documentation 

- [ ] Add power point slides into documentation

- [ ] Finish backend for displaying list of articles by topic 

- [ ] Upload finished code and documentation in pdf format to a flash drive to turn in thursday by 2:30pm

### Data & Analysis of articles

We want to use news articles as a source of data for machine learning classification and possible predictions based upon our calculated model. The first question we need to address is that of our dataset. 

#### Initial thoughts on data

We know we need more information. We are going to do a search on academic articles concerning language analysis metrics and determine a realistic scope for our analysis of news article text. 
     
The following is what we know:

- Python is good for analyzing text 

- Sentiment analysis is one possible text metric in regards to all data (any topic can be positive or negative, so a lot of simple binary data could be derived following this schema)

- There might be powerful languages at our disposal

**TL,DR;**

We need more research before we can decide how we want to approach gathering data from articles. 

#### Technologies we are considering

	[Kurt had a list written of some so far he might add]
	
	- Python
	

#### Initial thoughts on final product of application

Assuming we have the data to support it, we would like to accomplish the following:

- Use data to create metric that measures the ideological alignment of the article in question, and represent it graphically as:

	[diagram of cardinal direction metric thingy]
	
- Use classifiers created by dataset to predict the potential idealogical alignment of an article submitted for inspection by the application
