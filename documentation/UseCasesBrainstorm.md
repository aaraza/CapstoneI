the scope of our project.**

## Machine Learning Applications

- Analyze user given articles, and using bag of words dictionaries, predict political placement within political compass.

- Using language processing, find the top 3 most likely main topics from the article.

- Predict sentiment of article in regards to its main topic (e.g., the article is positive in regards to gun violence)
 
- Analyze how much hyperbole is used within an article using language analysis.

  - examples:
    - "What percentage of analyzed articles relate to women's rights or feminist movements?" 
    - "How much does CNN report on violence/crime relative to their total reporting?"

- For a news outlet (Fox, CBS, etc.), return a word visualization (word cloud) of the most fequently used words.
 

# Technologies
